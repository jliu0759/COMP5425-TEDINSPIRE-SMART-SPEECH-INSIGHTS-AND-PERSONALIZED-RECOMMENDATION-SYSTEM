WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 100.71 115.12 <o,f0,male> so a few years(2) ago i actually(4) started(2) getting(2) {NOISE} very interested(2) {BREATH} in the seti program {BREATH} and that's kind of the way i work is i get(2) interested in different kinds(2) of subjects i dive in i research them {BREATH} and then i try to figure out how to craft a toy around that so that(2) {BREATH} other people can kind of experience the same sense of discovery(2) as(2) i did <sil> as(2) i was learning that(2) subject {BREATH} (WillWright_2007-100.71-115.12-F0_M-S119)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 126.32 134.93 <o,f0,male> and {UH} i started(2) looking at how interesting doctorake 's(2) equation was because(2) it {NOISE} spanned all these different subjects(2) {BREATH} you know(2) <sil> physics chemistry(2) sociology {SMACK} economics(2) {BREATH} (WillWright_2007-126.32-134.93-F0_M-S119)

WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 142.31 149.03 <o,f0,male> and i started(2) kind of putting those two together and(2) wondering {BREATH} could i build a toy {BREATH} where kids would kind of trip across all these interesting principles of life {SMACK} you know(2) (WillWright_2007-142.31-149.03-F0_M-S119)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 149.20 157.92 <o,f0,male> as(2) it exists(2) and as it might go in the future {BREATH} things where(2) you might kind of {UH} trip across things like the(2) copernican principle {BREATH} the fermi paradox the(2) anthropic principle {BREATH} the origin of life <sil> (WillWright_2007-149.20-157.92-F0_M-S119)

WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 191.66 194.42 <o,f0,male> and(2) i actually(4) realize(2) that(2) cells don't have(2) eyes {BREATH} but {UH} (WillWright_2007-191.66-194.42-F0_M-S119)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 203.72 216.62 <o,f0,male> and as(3) we start growing the(2) camera will actually(2) start zooming out {BREATH} and things that(2) you see kind of in the background there {BREATH} will actually(4) start slowly <sil> pulling into the foreground {BREATH} showing you a little bit of what(2) you'll be interacting with(2) {BREATH} as(3) you grow {NOISE} so as we {NOISE} eat {BREATH} the camera starts pulling out <sil> (WillWright_2007-203.72-216.62-F0_M-S119)

WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 238.72 248.27 <o,f0,male> their creature <sil> and that's kind of a fundamental aspect of this now {BREATH} in the {UH} evolution game here the creature scale {BREATH} basically you have(2) to(2) {SMACK} eat <sil> survive {UH} and(2) then reproduce {SMACK} you know(2) very darwinian <sil> (WillWright_2007-238.72-248.27-F0_M-S119)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 248.76 257.10 <o,f0,male> one(2) thing we noticed with(2) the sims which(2) is a game i did {UH} earlier {BREATH} is that(2) players love making stuff when(4) they were(2) able to make stuff in the game they had a tremendous amount of empathy in connection to(3) it {BREATH} (WillWright_2007-248.76-257.10-F0_M-S119)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 271.06 272.67 <o,f0,male> and now {UM} we {SMACK} might try to(2) (WillWright_2007-271.06-272.67-F0_M-S40)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 313.73 321.44 <o,f0,male> <sil> with humans and all that because(2) it's kind of almost more interesting to look at {UH} alternate <sil> possibilities in evolution {COUGH} evolution is usually {NOISE} presented as like this one path that(2) we took {BREATH} through (WillWright_2007-313.73-321.44-F0_M-S104)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 321.83 330.44 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} but {NOISE} really it <sil> represents this huge {COUGH} set of possibilities {BREATH} now once we mate we actually(4) {COUGH} click on the(2) egg {BREATH} and this is where(2) the game starts getting(2) interesting because(2) {BREATH} one of the(2) {NOISE} things we really focused(2) on(2) here (WillWright_2007-321.83-330.44-F0_M-S119)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 32.87 34.89 <o,f0,male> i figure it's ok <sil> amongst this group {BREATH} (WillWright_2007-32.87-34.89-F0_M-S1)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 338.21 345.38 <o,f0,male> of intelligence kind of on(2) the tool side but basically this is the editor(2) where(2) we're going to design the next(2) generation of our creature {BREATH} so it has a little spine {COUGH} it can(2) kind of move around here <sil> (WillWright_2007-338.21-345.38-F0_M-S102)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 357.61 366.17 <o,f0,male> and(2) we'll basically bring it to life <sil> so for(2) instance i might put some limbs on(2) the character here <sil> i'll inflate them kind of large {SMACK} and {COUGH} in this case i might decide i'm going to put {UM} (WillWright_2007-357.61-366.17-F0_M-S102)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 375.14 381.00 <o,f0,male> very {COUGH} creative {COUGH} in the game {COUGH} here i'll give it like {NOISE} one(2) eye in the middle <sil> maybe <sil> scale it {SMACK} up a <sil> bit <sil> point it down <sil> <sil> (WillWright_2007-375.14-381.00-F0_M-S102)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 386.48 394.54 <o,f0,male> so basically in some sense we want <sil> this to(2) feel like kind of an(2) amplifier for(2) the player 's(3) imagination <sil> so that with(2) {UH} a very small number of {UH} clicks {NOISE} a player can(2) create something <sil> (WillWright_2007-386.48-394.54-F0_M-S57)

WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 417.53 425.98 <o,f0,male> so that's {SMACK} the complete model <sil> now we can(2) actually(4) go to the painting <sil> phase {BREATH} now at this phase the program actually(2) has some understanding of kind of the topology of this creature it kind of knows where(2) the backbone is <sil> (WillWright_2007-417.53-425.98-F0_M-S57)

WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 492.71 500.83 <o,f0,male> in the game that(2) the {NOISE} player can(2) create {NOISE} you know(2) all the way up through civilization {UH} this {NOISE} is my baby when i {NOISE} eat i'll actually(2) start {UM} growing {NOISE} this is {NOISE} the {NOISE} next generation {NOISE} but i'm(2) going to skip way ahead here <sil> <sil> (WillWright_2007-492.71-500.83-F0_M-S57)

WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 533.82 539.15 <o,f0,male> and how do we make {UH} these tools these editors something that(2) <sil> in fact {COUGH} are actually(3) just(2) as fun as the game itself <sil> (WillWright_2007-533.82-539.15-F0_M-S119)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 539.55 542.85 <o,f0,male> so this is the planet that(2) we've been playing on(2) up to this point in the game <sil> <sil> (WillWright_2007-539.55-542.85-F0_M-S119)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 543.49 549.72 <o,f0,male> so far the entire game has been played on the surface of this little world here {BREATH} now at this point we're actually(4) dealing with(2) a very {SMACK} little toy planet <sil> (WillWright_2007-543.49-549.72-F0_M-S102)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 55.35 63.08 <o,f0,male> it wasn't until later as(2) i started making games {BREATH} that i really i actually(2) think of them more as toys {SMACK} people call me a game designer but i really think of these things more as toys {SMACK} (WillWright_2007-55.35-63.08-F0_M-S119)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 558.92 569.80 <o,f0,male> this world {NOISE} was actually(4) extracted(2) from the player 's(3) imagination so this is the <sil> planet <sil> that(2) the player {NOISE} evolved(2) on(2) {BREATH} so things like the buildings and the vehicles(2) the(2) architecture <sil> civilizations {COUGH} were(2) all designed by the player up to this {SMACK} point <sil> (WillWright_2007-558.92-569.80-F0_M-S102)

WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 578.91 589.85 <o,f0,male> really(2) this is more about putting(2) the player in the role of george {NOISE} lucas {SMACK} you know(2) i want {SMACK} them after they've played this game {BREATH} to(2) have extracted(2) an(2) entire world that(2) they're now interacting with(2) {BREATH} now as we pull down here we actually(4) still have(2) a whole set of creatures {BREATH} <sil> (WillWright_2007-578.91-589.85-F0_M-S102)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 590.66 602.86 <o,f0,male> living on(2) the surface of the planet so all these different dynamics going on here {BREATH} in fact i can(2) look over here and this is kind of a little simplified food web that's going(2) on(2) with(2) the creatures {BREATH} i can(2) open this up and(2) then kind of actually(4) scan what(2) exists on the surface {SMACK} and get(2) some sense of the diversity(3) of creatures {BREATH} <sil> (WillWright_2007-590.66-602.86-F0_M-S102)

WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 63.78 77.19 <o,f0,male> but <sil> i started getting(2) very interested(2) in maria montessori and her methods and the kind of way she went about things and(2) the way {BREATH} she {NOISE} thought it {UH} very valuable for(2) kids to kind of discover things on their own rather than(2) being taught these things just(2) kind of overtly {BREATH} and she would design these toys where kids {NOISE} in playing with(2) the toys <sil> (WillWright_2007-63.78-77.19-F0_M-S119)

WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 673.72 675.82 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} so basically i want the players to be able to experiment (WillWright_2007-673.72-675.82-F0_M-S104)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 677.48 678.69 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} space so there goes one(2) {NOISE} (WillWright_2007-677.48-678.69-F0_M-S102)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 680.98 690.32 <o,f0,male> over time this is actually(2) going to heat up {SMACK} the planet so at first what(2) we're going to see is a global ocean rise here on this {SMACK} little toy planet {SMACK} but then over time i can(2) speed it up just(2) {SMACK} a little bit {BREATH} we'll actually(4) {NOISE} see the heat impact of that <sil> (WillWright_2007-680.98-690.32-F0_M-S104)

WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 717.59 723.29 <o,f0,male> so we're not only simulating kind of biological dynamics {NOISE} food webs and all that but also geologic you know(2) on(2) a very simple kind of <sil> core scale <sil> (WillWright_2007-717.59-723.29-F0_M-S102)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 723.86 734.26 <o,f0,male> and <sil> what's interesting(2) to me about games in some sense is that(2) i think we can(2) take a lot(2) of long term dynamics {BREATH} and compress(2) them {NOISE} into very short {UH} term kind of experiences {BREATH} because(2) it's so hard for(2) people to think fifty or(2) one(2) hundred(4) years out <sil> (WillWright_2007-723.86-734.26-F0_M-S102)

WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 890.40 899.46 <o,f0,male> is another thing where(2) like typically(2) when(4) people present galaxies <sil> it's always {COUGH} been(2) these very beautiful {UH} photos but they're always static {NOISE} and(2) when(4) you actually(4) {COUGH} bring it {COUGH} forward in time and(2) start animating it {BREATH} it's actually(4) kind of amazing <sil> (WillWright_2007-890.40-899.46-F0_M-S133)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 89.98 100.31 <o,f0,male> and(2) so the games that(2) i do {NOISE} i think of really more as modern montessori toys {BREATH} and {UH} i really kind of want(2) them <sil> to be presented in a way to where kids can(2) kind of {BREATH} explore and discover their own principles {SMACK} <sil> (WillWright_2007-89.98-100.31-F0_M-S119)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 902.23 905.52 <o,f0,male> <sil> second {COUGH} because(2) {NOISE} you have about {BREATH} roughly one(2) supernova {COUGH} every(2) {NOISE} (WillWright_2007-902.23-905.52-F0_M-S134)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 923.02 931.48 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} was kind of wondering what(2) kind of <sil> gods that(2) the players would become {UM} because(2) if you think about it you know(2) you're(2) going to have(2) fifteen year olds {COUGH} twenty year olds whatever(2) {BREATH} flying around this universe and they might {SMACK} be a nurturing god <sil> (WillWright_2007-923.02-931.48-F0_M-S133)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 951.30 954.24 <o,f0,male> <sil> basically <sil> the reason why(2) i make toys like this {SMACK} is <sil> because(2) (WillWright_2007-951.30-954.24-F0_M-S133)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 954.78 967.89 <o,f0,male> {COUGH} think if there's {COUGH} one(2) difference i could possibly make {NOISE} in the world {UH} that(2) i would choose to make <sil> it's that {BREATH} i would like to(2) somehow give people just(2) {COUGH} a little bit <sil> better calibration {NOISE} on(2) long term thinking {NOISE} because(2) i think most of the problems that(2) our world is facing {SMACK} right now <sil> (WillWright_2007-954.78-967.89-F0_M-S133)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 968.56 978.04 <o,f0,male> is <sil> the result of {NOISE} short term thinking and the fact that(2) it is so hard for(2) us to think fifty <sil> one(2) hundred years or(2) one(2) thousand years out <sil> and i think by giving kids toys like this and letting them replay dynamics <sil> (WillWright_2007-968.56-978.04-F0_M-S133)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 978.32 983.99 <o,f0,male> you know(2) very long term dynamics over the short term and getting(2) some sense of {SMACK} what(2) we're doing now {BREATH} what(2) it's going to(2) be like in one(2) hundred(4) years {BREATH} (WillWright_2007-978.32-983.99-F0_M-S133)
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 985.05 991.48 <o,f0,male> probably(2) is the most(2) effective thing i can(2) be doing probably(2) <sil> to help the world {BREATH} and so that's why(2) i think personally(2) that(2) toys can change the world <sil> <sil> (WillWright_2007-985.05-991.48-F0_M-S133)
