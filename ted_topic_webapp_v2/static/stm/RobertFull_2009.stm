RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 227.46 233.46 <o,f0,male> you can(2) see <sil> that it {NOISE} uses(3) <sil> the toe peeling <sil> just like {UH} the gecko {UH} (RobertFull_2009-227.46-233.46-F0_M-S35)

RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 242.24 251.82 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} there it is <sil> and now it can(2) go on {NOISE} other surfaces because(2) of the <sil> new adhesive(2) {SMACK} that <sil> the standford group <sil> was able to do in designing this incredible robot <sil> <sil> (RobertFull_2009-242.24-251.82-F0_M-S106)
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 255.66 263.36 <o,f0,male> one(2) thing i want to point out is look at stickybot {SMACK} you see something on it <sil> it's not just <sil> to look like a gecko {BREATH} it has(2) a tail <sil> (RobertFull_2009-255.66-263.36-F0_M-S102)
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 263.68 272.32 <o,f0,male> and(2) just when(4) you think you've figured out nature this kind of thing happens {BREATH} the(2) engineers told us for(2) the climbing robots(2) that if they don't have(2) a tail <sil> they fall off the wall <sil> (RobertFull_2009-263.68-272.32-F0_M-S102)

RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 280.19 286.19 <o,f0,male> kind of looks like a tail even though we put a passive bar there {BREATH} do {NOISE} animals use(2) their tails {BREATH} when(3) they climb up walls <sil> (RobertFull_2009-280.19-286.19-F0_M-S102)
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 295.66 303.35 <o,f0,male> in reality we were(2) then <sil> panicked {COUGH} being the biologists(3) and we should know(2) this already {BREATH} we said well <sil> what(2) do tails do <sil> well {NOISE} we know(2) that(2) tails store fat {BREATH} <sil> (RobertFull_2009-295.66-303.35-F0_M-S102)
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 29.77 37.03 <o,f0,male> in {NOISE} a scientific paper {BREATH} it's a story about {UH} beyond biomimetics to something <sil> i'm(2) calling biomutualism <sil> (RobertFull_2009-29.77-37.03-F0_M-S106)
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 303.68 311.97 <o,f0,male> for(2) example {SMACK} we know(2) that <sil> you can(2) grab onto things with them(2) {SMACK} and perhaps it is most(2) well known {SMACK} that they provide {NOISE} static balance (RobertFull_2009-303.68-311.97-F0_M-S102)
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 313.82 317.27 <o,f0,male> it can(2) also act as(2) a counterbalance(2) {SMACK} so watch this kangaroo <sil> (RobertFull_2009-313.82-317.27-F0_M-S102)
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 319.67 328.10 <o,f0,male> see that tail that's incredible {BREATH} marc raibert <sil> built {NOISE} a(2) uniroo {NOISE} hopping robot {SMACK} and it was {NOISE} unstable <sil> without its tail (RobertFull_2009-319.67-328.10-F0_M-S102)
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 331.70 336.71 <o,f0,male> now mostly tails limit maneuverability like this human inside this dinosaur suit <sil> (RobertFull_2009-331.70-336.71-F0_M-S102)
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 338.59 351.49 <o,f0,male> my <sil> colleagues actually(3) went on to test this {COUGH} limitation <sil> by {COUGH} increasing the moment of inertia {UH} of a student {SMACK} so they had a tail <sil> and running them(2) through and(2) obstacle course and found a(2) decrement in performance <sil> like you'd(2) predict <sil> (RobertFull_2009-338.59-351.49-F0_M-S102)
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 354.46 356.83 <o,f0,male> but of course {SMACK} this is a passive tail (RobertFull_2009-354.46-356.83-F0_M-S102)
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 374.38 380.51 <o,f0,male> talked about the tail being a whip(2) for(2) communication <sil> it can also be used in defense <sil> <sil> (RobertFull_2009-374.38-380.51-F0_M-S35)
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 37.62 48.08 <o,f0,male> i define that as(3) an(2) association(2) between biology and another discipline where each discipline {BREATH} reciprocally advances the(2) other <sil> but where(2) the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond {UH} any single field <sil> (RobertFull_2009-37.62-48.08-F0_M-S106)
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 382.03 389.95 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} pretty {BREATH} powerful {NOISE} so {NOISE} we {NOISE} then <sil> went {NOISE} back and(2) looked at the animal <sil> and we ran it up a surface but this time what(2) we did is we put a slippery(2) <sil> patch <sil> (RobertFull_2009-382.03-389.95-F0_M-S102)
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 390.24 403.07 <o,f0,male> that(2) you see in yellow there {BREATH} and watch on the right what(2) the {NOISE} animal is doing with(2) its tail <sil> when(3) it slips this is slowed down ten times {BREATH} so here is normal speed {SMACK} and watch it now slip <sil> and see what(2) it does with its tail <sil> (RobertFull_2009-390.24-403.07-F0_M-S102)
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 406.39 414.49 <o,f0,male> it has an active tail that functions as a fifth leg and it contributes to stability <sil> if you make it slip {COUGH} a {UH} huge amount {UH} this is what(2) we discovered <sil> (RobertFull_2009-406.39-414.49-F0_M-S102)

RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 438.94 441.41 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} and we did that experiment {COUGH} that you see here {COUGH} (RobertFull_2009-438.94-441.41-F0_M-S101)
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 444.11 447.32 <o,f0,male> {UH} now that's real time you can't see anything {SMACK} but there it is slowed down <sil> (RobertFull_2009-444.11-447.32-F0_M-S101)
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 465.39 472.64 <o,f0,male> so they do it with this active tail as(3) they {SMACK} swing around and(2) then they always(2) land {SMACK} in the sort of superman <sil> skydiving posture <sil> <sil> (RobertFull_2009-465.39-472.64-F0_M-S102)
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 474.55 481.58 <o,f0,male> okay now we wondered if we were(2) {NOISE} right {BREATH} we should be able to test this in a physical model in a robot {BREATH} so for(2) ted we actually(3) built a(2) robot {BREATH} (RobertFull_2009-474.55-481.58-F0_M-S102)

RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 502.93 508.48 <o,f0,male> and(2) it works just like it does in the(2) animal <sil> so <sil> all you need is a swing of the tail {UH} to right yourself(3) <sil> (RobertFull_2009-502.93-508.48-F0_M-S102)
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 511.81 520.47 <o,f0,male> now of course we were(2) normally frightened because(2) <sil> the animal has no gliding adaptations(2) so {UH} we thought {UH} oh that's okay we'll put it in a vertical wind(2) tunnel {BREATH} we'll blow the(2) air up (RobertFull_2009-511.81-520.47-F0_M-S102)
