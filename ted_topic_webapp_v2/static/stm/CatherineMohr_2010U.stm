CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 203.28 216.82 <o,f0,female> we then put {UH} in framing <sil> and so this is framing {NOISE} lumber {UH} composite(2) materials {BREATH} and it's kind of hard to get the(2) embodied energy {NOISE} out of that {UH} but it can be a {NOISE} sustainable resource if you use {NOISE} f s c certified lumber <sil> (CatherineMohr_2010U-203.28-216.82-F0_F-S19)
