EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 796.82 809.57 <o,f0,female> muscle somehow intuitively knows that {NOISE} it {NOISE} needs this blood supply {BREATH} it {NOISE} needs to be constantly contracting so therefore it's almost selfish {NOISE} it's grabbing its blood vessels for(2) itself {BREATH} therefore when(3) a tumor <sil> comes into skeletal muscle tissue(2) {SMACK} (EvaVertes_2005-796.82-809.57-F0_F-S102)
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 810.14 817.93 <o,f0,female> it can't get(2) a blood supply and can't grow {BREATH} so this suggests(3) {SMACK} that <sil> maybe if there <sil> is an <sil> anti(2) {NOISE} angiogenic <sil> factor in skeletal muscle <sil> (EvaVertes_2005-810.14-817.93-F0_F-S102)

EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 849.04 862.61 <o,f0,female> so {UH} a tumor {BREATH} expresses(2) {SMACK} chemokine {NOISE} receptors {BREATH} and another organ <sil> a distant organ somewhere(2) in the body {BREATH} will have(2) the corresponding {NOISE} chemokines <sil> and the tumor <sil> will(2) see these <sil> chemokines <sil> and migrate towards it {SMACK} (EvaVertes_2005-849.04-862.61-F0_F-S102)
