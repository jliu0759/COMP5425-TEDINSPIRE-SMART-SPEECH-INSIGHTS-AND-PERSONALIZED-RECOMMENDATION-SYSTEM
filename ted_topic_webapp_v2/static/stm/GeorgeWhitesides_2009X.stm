GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 664.23 672.45 <o,f0,male> now let me show you just a little bit about advanced devices(2) and {NOISE} we'll start by posing a little problem {BREATH} what you see here is another centimeter sized device {BREATH} (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-664.23-672.45-F0_M-S150)
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 673.12 680.63 <o,f0,male> and(2) {COUGH} the(2) different colors are different(2) <sil> colors of dye {BREATH} and you notice(2) something which(2) {SMACK} might strike you as a little bit interesting(4) which(2) is <sil> (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-673.12-680.63-F0_M-S150)

GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 698.93 711.25 <o,f0,male> and(2) {UH} the(2) answer is {NOISE} that what you do {UH} and(2) the details(2) are(2) not terribly important here {BREATH} is to make something more elaborate(2) {SMACK} you take several different(2) layers of paper each one(2) containing its own <sil> little fluid(2) system <sil> (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-698.93-711.25-F0_M-S150)
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 711.60 718.67 <o,f0,male> and you separate them by pieces(2) {UH} of {SMACK} literally double sided carpet tape <sil> the stuff you use(2) to stick the carpets onto the floor <sil> (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-711.60-718.67-F0_M-S150)
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 719.13 726.71 <o,f0,male> and(2) {NOISE} the fluid(2) will flow from(2) one {UM} layer <sil> into the next(2) {NOISE} it distributes itself {BREATH} flows through further holes <sil> distributes itself <sil> (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-719.13-726.71-F0_M-S150)

GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 746.14 754.62 <o,f0,male> and(2) in this particular(2) case we were(2) just interested(4) in the replicability of that {COUGH} but that {NOISE} is {NOISE} in <sil> principle the way you solve the fever of <sil> unexplained origin problem <sil> (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-746.14-754.62-F0_M-S150)
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 754.98 760.75 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} because(2) each one(2) of those spots then becomes a(2) test for a(2) particular(2) <sil> set of {UH} markers of disease <sil> (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-754.98-760.75-F0_M-S150)
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 761.27 775.60 <o,f0,male> and(2) <sil> this will work in due course {BREATH} and here is an example of a slightly more complicated device {BREATH} there is the chip {BREATH} you dip in a corner <sil> the fluid(2) goes into the center(2) <sil> it distributes itself out into these various <sil> wells or <sil> holes and turns color(2) <sil> (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-761.27-775.60-F0_M-S150)
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 77.28 89.62 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} so <sil> the(2) technology that i want to talk about {BREATH} is {NOISE} for the third world for the developing world {BREATH} but {NOISE} it has i think {NOISE} much broader application <sil> because {SMACK} information(2) is so important in the healthcare system <sil> (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-77.28-89.62-F0_M-S3)

GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 784.75 797.31 <o,f0,male> now i have(2) one(2) last(2) {NOISE} two last(2) little stories to tell you <sil> in finishing off this <sil> business {BREATH} this is one(2) {UM} one of the things that one(2) does occasionally(2) need to do is to separate blood {UM} cells from serum <sil> <sil> (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-784.75-797.31-F0_M-S150)
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 798.18 804.32 <o,f0,male> and(2) {NOISE} the question was <sil> here we do it by taking a sample {BREATH} we put it in <sil> a centrifuge (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-798.18-804.32-F0_M-S150)
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 804.75 812.36 <o,f0,male> we spin it {BREATH} and {SMACK} you get <sil> blood cells out <sil> terrific {SMACK} what happens if you don't have(2) an(2) electricity {UH} and(2) a centrifuge and(2) whatever <sil> (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-804.75-812.36-F0_M-S150)
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 813.14 819.61 <o,f0,male> and(2) we thought for(2) a while(2) of how you might <sil> do this and(2) the way in fact <sil> you do it {BREATH} is what's shown here you get an(2) <sil> eggbeater <sil> (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-813.14-819.61-F0_M-S150)
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 820.09 826.96 <o,f0,male> which(2) is everywhere {BREATH} and you saw off a blade <sil> and(2) then you take <sil> tubing and you stick it on(2) that you put the blood in you {NOISE} spin it somebody {NOISE} (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-820.09-826.96-F0_M-S150)
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 828.66 841.29 <o,f0,male> really really well <sil> and {BREATH} we said {NOISE} that we did the physics of eggbeaters and(2) self aligning tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing {BREATH} sent it off to(3) a journal we were(2) very {UM} proud {NOISE} of {BREATH} this {NOISE} particularly(2) the title {NOISE} which(2) was eggbeater as(2) centrifuge <sil> (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-828.66-841.29-F0_M-S150)
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 841.97 849.34 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} and we sent it off {BREATH} and by return mail it came back {BREATH} i <sil> called up the(2) editor and i said what(2) 's(3) going(2) on(2) <sil> how is this possible (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-841.97-849.34-F0_M-S150)
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 849.62 858.18 <o,f0,male> the editor said <sil> with {NOISE} enormous(4) disdain <sil> i read this {BREATH} and we're not going to publish it because(2) we {NOISE} only publish {SMACK} science <sil> <sil> (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-849.62-858.18-F0_M-S150)
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 859.55 870.49 <o,f0,male> {COUGH} and {NOISE} it's an important issue because(2) it means that {BREATH} we have(2) to(3) as(3) a society {BREATH} think about {UH} what(2) we value <sil> and if it's just papers and(2) phys rev letters {BREATH} we've got a problem <sil> (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-859.55-870.49-F0_M-S150)
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 871.07 884.62 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} here is {NOISE} another {NOISE} example {COUGH} of {NOISE} something <sil> which(2) {BREATH} is this is a little spectrophotometer {SMACK} it <sil> measures <sil> the(2) absorption of light {SMACK} in a sample <sil> the neat thing about this is you have(2) light source that(2) flickers on(2) and off at about one(2) {NOISE} thousand hertz(2) <sil> (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-871.07-884.62-F0_M-S150)

GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 891.47 897.84 <o,f0,male> it performs {UH} about equivalently <sil> to(3) a(2) {BREATH} system that's in the(2) order of {COUGH} one(2) {BREATH} hundred thousand dollars <sil> (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-891.47-897.84-F0_M-S150)
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 90.34 101.99 <o,f0,male> so you see two examples here one is a <sil> lab that(2) is {NOISE} actually(4) a fairly high end <sil> laboratory in <sil> africa {BREATH} the {UM} second(2) is basically an entrepreneur(2) who is set up and doing who knows what <sil> (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-90.34-101.99-F0_M-S3)
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 916.11 929.19 <o,f0,male> we thought about this as(3) a {NOISE} kind of engineering problem <sil> and {BREATH} we've asked what is {NOISE} the scientific {SMACK} unifying idea {UH} here {BREATH} and we've decided that we should think about this <sil> not so much in terms of cost(2) {BREATH} but in terms of simplicity <sil> (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-916.11-929.19-F0_M-S150)
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 956.80 968.45 <o,f0,male> and(2) i want to give you the(2) {NOISE} answer of this {BREATH} deep {UH} scientific thought <sil> so {COUGH} in {NOISE} a {NOISE} sense <sil> you get what you pay for <sil> thank you very much {COUGH} (GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-956.80-968.45-F0_M-S150)
