RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 427.18 433.36 <o,f0,female> that(2) we get what looks more like {NOISE} an adult response r <sil> s {SMACK} should {NOISE} ivan get in trouble for(2) taking joshua 's(3) sandwich <sil> (RebeccaSaxe_2009G-427.18-433.36-F0_F-S39)

RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 484.21 490.54 <o,f0,female> and(2) so {BREATH} what we can(2) see is that over the course of childhood and even into adolescence {BREATH} both the cognitive system <sil> (RebeccaSaxe_2009G-484.21-490.54-F0_F-S22)
