JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 166.34 178.37 <o,f0,male> so {UH} bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to <sil> exponential(2) growth in their numbers {BREATH} so that's {UH} no great surprise {SMACK} but what(2) was really interesting to me was to find out that(2) <sil> the birds were(2) <sil> adapting in a <sil> pretty unusual {NOISE} way <sil> <sil> (JoshuaKlein_2008-166.34-178.37-F0_M-S12)

JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 182.18 190.92 <o,f0,male> so this is betty she's a new(2) caledonian crow {BREATH} and these crows use {UH} sticks in the wild <sil> to get(2) <sil> insects and whatnot(2) {UH} out of <sil> pieces of wood {BREATH} here she's trying(2) to get a piece of meat out of <sil> (JoshuaKlein_2008-182.18-190.92-F0_M-S10)

JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 235.26 242.60 <o,f0,male> so it turns out we've been {NOISE} finding more and(2) more that(2) crows are(2) really(2) really intelligent their brains are(2) proportionate in the same proportion as(2) {UH} chimpanzee brains are {BREATH} (JoshuaKlein_2008-235.26-242.60-F0_M-S10)
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 24.49 36.66 <o,f0,male> so {UH} this is a vending machine for(2) crows and over the {UH} past few days many of you have been asking me how did you <sil> come to this how did you get(2) started doing this {BREATH} and it started as(2) with <sil> many great ideas or <sil> many ideas you can't get rid of anyway <sil> at a cocktail party <sil> (JoshuaKlein_2008-24.49-36.66-F0_M-S10)
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 252.76 257.98 <o,f0,male> the crows fly down reel up the lines and eat the fish {SMACK} or the <sil> bait {BREATH} it's pretty {NOISE} annoying for(2) the fishermen {BREATH} (JoshuaKlein_2008-252.76-257.98-F0_M-S10)

JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 311.96 318.27 <o,f0,male> so we know(2) that(2) these crows are(2) really smart but <sil> the {NOISE} more i dug into this the more i found that(2) they actually(4) have(2) {UH} an {NOISE} even more significant(2) {COUGH} adaptation {SMACK} <sil> (JoshuaKlein_2008-311.96-318.27-F0_M-S10)

JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 369.95 375.28 <o,f0,male> pretty interesting {BREATH} so what's(2) significant(2) about this isn't that crows are using cars to crack nuts in fact that's {SMACK} <sil> (JoshuaKlein_2008-369.95-375.28-F0_M-S36)
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 37.05 45.02 <o,f0,male> {UM} about {SMACK} ten years(2) ago i was(2) at a cocktail party with(2) a friend of mine and {UH} we're sitting there and(2) <sil> he(2) was complaining about the crows that(2) he had <sil> seen that were(2) <sil> all over his(2) yard and(2) making a big mess <sil> (JoshuaKlein_2008-37.05-45.02-F0_M-S10)

JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 392.42 404.90 <o,f0,male> so they're learning from each other and research {SMACK} bears this out {BREATH} parents seem to be teaching their young {UM} they've {SMACK} learned from their peers they've learned from their {NOISE} enemies if i have a {UH} little extra time i'll tell you about a <sil> case of crow infidelity that {COUGH} illustrates that nicely {BREATH} (JoshuaKlein_2008-392.42-404.90-F0_M-S10)
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 406.35 413.79 <o,f0,male> the point being that they've {NOISE} developed cultural adaptation <sil> and as we heard yesterday that's the pandora 's(3) box that's getting(2) human beings in trouble {BREATH} and we're starting to see it with {NOISE} (JoshuaKlein_2008-406.35-413.79-F0_M-S10)

JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 433.70 441.14 <o,f0,male> so that's what(2) we did {COUGH} this is a vending machine for crows <sil> and it uses(3) skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages {BREATH} it's pretty simple {BREATH} (JoshuaKlein_2008-433.70-441.14-F0_M-S10)
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 45.69 54.77 <o,f0,male> me that really we ought to try and eradicate these things we gotta kill them <sil> because(2) they're making a mess {BREATH} i said that was stupid(2) you know(2) maybe we should just train them to do something useful {BREATH} and he(2) said that was impossible <sil> (JoshuaKlein_2008-45.69-54.77-F0_M-S10)

JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 494.92 506.69 <o,f0,male> and(2) so this goes on for(2) some time the crows learn that(2) all they have to do is show up {BREATH} wait for(2) the coin to(2) come out put the coin in the slot and(2) then they get their peanut {BREATH} and when(4) they're really good and(2) comfortable with that {BREATH} we move to the final stage {SMACK} in which(2) they show up and nothing happens <sil> (JoshuaKlein_2008-494.92-506.69-F0_M-S10)

JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 552.21 563.11 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} so <sil> what's significant(2) about this to me isn't that we can(2) train crows to pick up peanuts {UM} mind you there's two hundred(4) and sixteen million dollars worth of change lost every(2) year {BREATH} but i'm not sure i can(2) depend on that {UH} roi from crows {BREATH} (JoshuaKlein_2008-552.21-563.11-F0_M-S10)
