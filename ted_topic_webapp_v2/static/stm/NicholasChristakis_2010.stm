NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 260.86 272.32 <o,f0,male> <sil> well <sil> what might be causing this clustering <sil> there are(2) at least three possibilities {BREATH} one possibility is that as {COUGH} i gain weight {COUGH} it causes you to gain weight {BREATH} a kind of induction a kind of spread from(2) person to person <sil> <sil> (NicholasChristakis_2010-260.86-272.32-F0_M-S156)

NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 662.01 671.78 <o,f0,male> this work with emotions {BREATH} which are so fundamental(2) <sil> then got us to thinking {BREATH} about maybe {NOISE} the {UH} fundamental(2) causes(2) of human social networks <sil> are somehow encoded <sil> in our genes {SMACK} (NicholasChristakis_2010-662.01-671.78-F0_M-S101)

NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 736.73 749.82 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} but certain <sil> other aspects of social network structure are not so obvious {BREATH} compare node b in the upper left {BREATH} to node <sil> a(2) in the lower left <sil> and now those people both have four friends {BREATH} but a(2) 's friends(2) all know(2) each other {BREATH} and b 's friends(2) do {NOISE} not {SMACK} (NicholasChristakis_2010-736.73-749.82-F0_M-S102)

NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 848.98 857.05 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} and(2) finally we even found that(2) <sil> thirty {NOISE} percent of the variation {SMACK} in whether(2) or(2) not people are(2) in the middle or(2) on the(2) <sil> edge of the network <sil> can also be attributed to their genes <sil> (NicholasChristakis_2010-848.98-857.05-F0_M-S101)
