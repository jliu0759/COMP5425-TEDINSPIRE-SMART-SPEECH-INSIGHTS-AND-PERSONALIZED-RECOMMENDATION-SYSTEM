TodMachover_2008 1 TodMachover_2008 802.20 812.62 <o,f0,female> <sil> {UM} yes <sil> so tod and(2) i entered(2) into(2) a discussion {SMACK} following the tewksbury work <sil> and it was really about how dan <sil> is an(2) expressive person and <sil> he 's <sil> an intelligent and(2) creative person {SMACK} and <sil> (TodMachover_2008-802.20-812.62-F0_F-S127)
TodMachover_2008 1 TodMachover_2008 821.26 832.98 <o,f0,female> so we started developing a technology {BREATH} that will allow him with nuance with precision with(2) control {BREATH} and {SMACK} despite his physical <sil> disability to be able to do that to be able to perform <sil> his piece of music {BREATH} so <sil> <sil> (TodMachover_2008-821.26-832.98-F0_F-S127)
TodMachover_2008 1 TodMachover_2008 833.31 844.14 <o,f0,female> the process and the technology basically first we needed(2) an engineering solution so <sil> you know(2) we have a firewire camera it looked at an(2) infrared pointer we went with the type of <sil> gesture {UM} metaphor that(2) {NOISE} he(2) was already(2) used to (TodMachover_2008-833.31-844.14-F0_F-S127)

TodMachover_2008 1 TodMachover_2008 857.49 869.89 <o,f0,female> but {NOISE} then was the really interesting aspect of the work {UH} following the engineering part {BREATH} where <sil> basically we're coding over dan 's(3) shoulder at the hospital extensively to figure out {NOISE} you know(2) how does(2) dan move {BREATH} what's useful to him as an expressive <sil> motion <sil> (TodMachover_2008-857.49-869.89-F0_F-S127)
TodMachover_2008 1 TodMachover_2008 870.15 879.16 <o,f0,female> you know(2) what's his metaphor for(2) performance what {UH} types of things {BREATH} does(2) he <sil> find important to control and convey in a piece of music {BREATH} so all the parameter fitting and really <sil> (TodMachover_2008-870.15-879.16-F0_F-S127)
TodMachover_2008 1 TodMachover_2008 889.57 902.41 <o,f0,female> they provide access they allow us to create pieces(2) of creative work {SMACK} but what about expression(2) what(2) about that moment when(3) an artist delivers <sil> that <sil> piece of work you know(2) do our technologies allow us to(3) {SMACK} express {SMACK} do they <sil> provide structure for(2) us to do that <sil> (TodMachover_2008-889.57-902.41-F0_F-S127)
TodMachover_2008 1 TodMachover_2008 902.84 916.00 <o,f0,female> and {SMACK} you know(2) thats a personal relationship to expression(2) {BREATH} that(2) {UM} is lacking in the technological spheres so {BREATH} you know(2) with dan we needed(2) a new design process a new engineering process {SMACK} to(2) sort of {SMACK} discover his movement and his path to expression(2) that allow him to perform <sil> (TodMachover_2008-902.84-916.00-F0_F-S127)
TodMachover_2008 1 TodMachover_2008 916.40 917.57 <o,f0,female> and(2) {UH} so that's what(2) {SMACK} we'll do (TodMachover_2008-916.40-917.57-F0_F-S127)
TodMachover_2008 1 TodMachover_2008 917.96 922.36 <o,f0,male> so let 's(2) do it {BREATH} so dan do {NOISE} you want to <sil> tell everyone {NOISE} about what {SMACK} you're(2) <sil> going {NOISE} to(3) {NOISE} play now (TodMachover_2008-917.96-922.36-F0_M-S105)
TodMachover_2008 1 TodMachover_2008 92.04 100.36 <o,f0,male> when we started(2) making these i started(2) thinking {NOISE} why can't we make wonderful instruments like that for(2) everybody <sil> people who aren't(2) {BREATH} fantastic {UH} yo yo mas or princes(2) <sil> (TodMachover_2008-92.04-100.36-F0_M-S105)

TodMachover_2008 1 TodMachover_2008 932.65 942.40 <o,f0,male> so dan is going to play a piece of his called my eagle song in fact {UM} this is the score of {NOISE} dan 's(2) piece {BREATH} completely composed by dan in hyperscore {UH} so he can use(2) {BREATH} his infrared <sil> (TodMachover_2008-932.65-942.40-F0_M-S105)
TodMachover_2008 1 TodMachover_2008 952.14 956.58 <o,f0,female> 's(3) really modest {UH} too {COUGH} so he can(2) go in {SMACK} <sil> (TodMachover_2008-952.14-956.58-F0_F-S119)
TodMachover_2008 1 TodMachover_2008 967.52 977.85 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} draws {NOISE} the {UM} lines places everything the way he wants to(3) {BREATH} looking at the hyperscore you can(2) see it also you can(2) see {SMACK} where the sections are something might {SMACK} continue for(2) a while(2) {BREATH} change get really crazy (TodMachover_2008-967.52-977.85-F0_M-S105)
TodMachover_2008 1 TodMachover_2008 978.59 980.97 <o,f0,male> and(2) then end up with a {NOISE} big bang at the(2) end {BREATH} <sil> (TodMachover_2008-978.59-980.97-F0_M-S155)
TodMachover_2008 1 TodMachover_2008 982.74 985.53 <o,f0,male> so <sil> that's the way he made his(2) piece <sil> and as adam says {BREATH} <sil> (TodMachover_2008-982.74-985.53-F0_M-S155)
TodMachover_2008 1 TodMachover_2008 987.09 989.59 <o,f0,male> we then figured out <sil> the best way to have(2) him {UH} (TodMachover_2008-987.09-989.59-F0_M-S155)
