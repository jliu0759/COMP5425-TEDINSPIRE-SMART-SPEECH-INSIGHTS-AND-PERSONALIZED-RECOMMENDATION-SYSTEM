TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 816.75 829.85 <o,f0,male> one(2) thing which(2) we {SMACK} did for a laugh was to create a slightly more complex stunt scene and one of the most famous stunts is the one(2) where(2) james bond {UH} jumps off a dam in switzerland {UM} and then is caught(2) by a {NOISE} bungee {SMACK} got {UM} a(2) {BREATH} very short {NOISE} clip here <sil> (TorstenReil_2003-816.75-829.85-F0_M-S103)
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 834.48 842.49 <o,f0,male> just about see it here {BREATH} in {UM} this case they were(2) using a real stunt man {NOISE} it was a very dangerous stunt it was just voted(2) i think in the sunday(2) times as one(2) of the most impressive stunts <sil> (TorstenReil_2003-834.48-842.49-F0_M-S103)
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 859.43 867.82 <o,f0,male> caught(2) by a bungee {BREATH} afterwards {BREATH} we did {COUGH} that {UH} it took about {NOISE} two hours pretty much to create the simulation <sil> and(2) that's what(2) it looks like here <sil> (TorstenReil_2003-859.43-867.82-F0_M-S103)
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 877.47 887.58 <o,f0,male> now this could do with a bit more work <sil> it's still {COUGH} very early stages(2) and(2) <sil> we pretty much just did this for a laugh just(2) to see <sil> what(2) we'd get out of it <sil> but what(2) we found {BREATH} over the past few months is that {UH} this {NOISE} approach {NOISE} (TorstenReil_2003-877.47-887.58-F0_M-S103)
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 889.52 899.00 <o,f0,male> is incredibly powerful {SMACK} we are {UH} ourselves surprised what you actually(2) get out of {UH} the simulations {BREATH} there's very often very surprising {COUGH} behavior {UH} that(2) you didn't(3) predict before <sil> (TorstenReil_2003-889.52-899.00-F0_M-S103)
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 899.62 911.88 <o,f0,male> so many things we can(2) do with(2) this right now {BREATH} the {UM} first thing as i said is going to be virtual stunt men {UM} several(2) studios {COUGH} are using this software(2) now {BREATH} to(2) produce virtual stunt men {COUGH} and they're going to hit the screen <sil> quite soon actually(2) for {SMACK} some major productions(2) {BREATH} (TorstenReil_2003-899.62-911.88-F0_M-S103)
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 912.87 918.91 <o,f0,male> the second thing is {UM} video games {UH} with this technology video games will(2) {NOISE} look {SMACK} different and they will feel very different <sil> (TorstenReil_2003-912.87-918.91-F0_M-S103)

TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 931.48 943.16 <o,f0,male> <sil> but i <sil> particularly(2) am really excited(2) about using this technology {SMACK} in {NOISE} online worlds {UH} like {BREATH} there for(2) example {UH} that(2) tom melcher has shown us {BREATH} the(2) degree of interactivity(2) you're going to get(2) <sil> is totally different {SMACK} i think {SMACK} from what(2) you're getting right now <sil> (TorstenReil_2003-931.48-943.16-F0_M-S103)

TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 96.14 108.74 <o,f0,male> in the computer game {SMACK} now <sil> the result of {SMACK} that is that {UM} you can't {UM} have(2) {UM} real interactivity(2) {BREATH} all you have(2) is <sil> animations that are played {COUGH} back {BREATH} at {SMACK} more or less {UM} the(2) appropriate times {BREATH} it also means that {NOISE} (TorstenReil_2003-96.14-108.74-F0_M-S12)
