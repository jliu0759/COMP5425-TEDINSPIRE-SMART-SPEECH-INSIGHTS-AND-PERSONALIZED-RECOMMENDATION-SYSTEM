TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 788.66 801.96 <o,f0,male> so why(2) design thinking <sil> because(2) it gives us a new(2) way of tackling(2) problems {BREATH} instead of <sil> defaulting to(3) our {UH} normal convergent approach {BREATH} where we {BREATH} make the best choice {NOISE} out of available alternatives {BREATH} (TimBrown_2009G-788.66-801.96-F0_M-S102)
TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 802.59 810.65 <o,f0,male> it encourages(2) {UH} us to take a divergent approach {BREATH} to explore new(2) alternatives {BREATH} new(2) solutions {SMACK} new(2) ideas {BREATH} that(2) have not existed before <sil> (TimBrown_2009G-802.59-810.65-F0_M-S102)
TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 811.59 825.44 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} but {NOISE} before(2) {SMACK} we <sil> go through that process of divergence {BREATH} there is actually(2) quite an(2) important first step <sil> and that is what is the question(2) that we're trying(2) to {UM} answer <sil> what's the design brief {BREATH} now {UM} brunel may have asked(2) a question like this {BREATH} how do i take a train from london to new york (TimBrown_2009G-811.59-825.44-F0_M-S102)
TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 827.80 831.45 <o,f0,male> but what(2) are(2) the kinds of questions that we might {UH} ask today <sil> (TimBrown_2009G-827.80-831.45-F0_M-S127)
TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 831.76 834.91 <o,f0,male> so these are(2) some {SMACK} that(2) we've been asked(2) <sil> to(2) {UH} think about recently(2) (TimBrown_2009G-831.76-834.91-F0_M-S111)
TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 837.26 845.90 <o,f0,male> and(2) one(2) in particular(2) {UH} is one that(2) we're(2) working on(2) with the acumen fund {BREATH} in a project that's been(2) funded by the bill and(2) melinda gates foundation <sil> how might we improve <sil> (TimBrown_2009G-837.26-845.90-F0_M-S102)

TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 855.57 864.63 <o,f0,male> so instead of having a bunch of american(2) designers come up with(2) {UH} new(2) ideas that(2) may or may not have been(2) appropriate {BREATH} we took a sort of more {UM} open {BREATH} collaborative(2) and(2) participative approach <sil> <sil> (TimBrown_2009G-855.57-864.63-F0_M-S102)
TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 865.03 875.35 <o,f0,male> we teamed designers and investment experts up with(2) {BREATH} eleven water organizations across india {BREATH} and through workshops {BREATH} they {NOISE} developed {NOISE} innovative new products(2) services and business models <sil> <sil> (TimBrown_2009G-865.03-875.35-F0_M-S102)
TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 86.57 97.66 <o,f0,male> but {COUGH} i think this small view of design {NOISE} is a relatively recent <sil> phenomena {UH} and(2) in fact really emerged {BREATH} in the(2) {SMACK} latter half of the twentieth(3) century {BREATH} as design became a tool <sil> of consumerism <sil> (TimBrown_2009G-86.57-97.66-F0_M-S11)
TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 875.84 889.28 <o,f0,male> we hosted a competition {BREATH} and(2) then funded(2) five of those organizations {UM} to develop their ideas <sil> so they developed and(2) iterated these ideas {BREATH} and then {UH} ideo and(2) acumen spent several weeks working with them {BREATH} to help design {BREATH} new(2) {SMACK} <sil> (TimBrown_2009G-875.84-889.28-F0_M-S102)

TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 899.77 907.75 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} those ideas are(2) just getting launched into the market(2) {BREATH} and the same process is just getting underway {BREATH} with {NOISE} ngos <sil> in {NOISE} east africa <sil> so for(2) me <sil> (TimBrown_2009G-899.77-907.75-F0_M-S102)
TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 908.15 917.15 <o,f0,male> this project shows {BREATH} kind of how far {UM} we can(2) go from {BREATH} some {UH} of {NOISE} those sort of {SMACK} small things {BREATH} that(2) i was working on <sil> at {UH} the beginning of my career <sil> (TimBrown_2009G-908.15-917.15-F0_M-S102)

TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 941.25 949.29 <o,f0,male> so {BREATH} that's one(2) thing that we've {NOISE} been(2) working on(2) {UH} i'm(2) actually(2) really <sil> quite interested(3) and(2) perhaps more interested(3) to know(2) what(2) {BREATH} this community {SMACK} thinks <sil> (TimBrown_2009G-941.25-949.29-F0_M-S102)
TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 949.58 956.65 <o,f0,male> we could work on {BREATH} what(2) {UH} kinds of questions do {UH} we think {NOISE} design thinking could be used to tackle {BREATH} and {UH} (TimBrown_2009G-949.58-956.65-F0_M-S102)

TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 975.96 984.52 <o,f0,male> believe that(2) design thinking actually(2) can make {BREATH} a difference that it can help {BREATH} create new(2) ideas {BREATH} and(2) {NOISE} new(2) innovations {UH} beyond(3) the latest high street products(2) <sil> (TimBrown_2009G-975.96-984.52-F0_M-S111)
TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 98.25 111.02 <o,f0,male> so when(4) we {COUGH} talk about design today and particularly(2) when(4) we read(2) about it in the popular press {BREATH} we're(3) often(2) talking about products like these <sil> amusing yes <sil> desirable(2) <sil> maybe {BREATH} important <sil> not so very {BREATH} <sil> (TimBrown_2009G-98.25-111.02-F0_M-S11)
TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 984.90 993.48 <o,f0,male> to do that i think we have(2) to take a more expansive view {BREATH} of design {BREATH} more like brunel {BREATH} less <sil> a(2) <sil> domain {UH} of {UH} a professional priesthood {SMACK} <sil> (TimBrown_2009G-984.90-993.48-F0_M-S111)
