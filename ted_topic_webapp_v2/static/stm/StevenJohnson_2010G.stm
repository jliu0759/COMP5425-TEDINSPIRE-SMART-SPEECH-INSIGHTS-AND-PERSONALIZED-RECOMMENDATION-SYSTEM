StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 783.97 794.20 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} and {NOISE} they {UH} start talking and {NOISE} one(2) of them says {BREATH} hey {NOISE} has anybody tried to listen {SMACK} for this thing <sil> there's this <sil> you know(2) man made <sil> satellite up there in outer space that's obviously broadcasting some kind of signal we <sil> (StevenJohnson_2010G-783.97-794.20-F0_M-S110)
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 795.41 806.34 <o,f0,male> if we tune in {BREATH} and so they ask around(2) to(3) a couple of their colleagues {UM} and everybody 's(3) like no i hadn't thought of doing that that's {UH} an(2) interesting idea {BREATH} and it turns out {NOISE} weiffenbach is kind of {NOISE} an {SMACK} expert in <sil> microwave <sil> (StevenJohnson_2010G-795.41-806.34-F0_M-S110)
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 807.32 821.00 <o,f0,male> and(2) he(2) 's(3) got a <sil> little antennae set up <sil> with an(2) amplifier in his(2) {BREATH} office {BREATH} and so guier and(2) weiffenbach go back to weiffenbach 's(2) office {SMACK} and they start kind of noodling around hacking <sil> as we might {SMACK} call it now {BREATH} and after a couple of hours they actually(4) start {UH} picking up the signal because(2) the soviets made <sil> (StevenJohnson_2010G-807.32-821.00-F0_M-S110)
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 821.76 830.28 <o,f0,male> sputnik very <sil> easy to track it was right at <sil> twenty mhz so {NOISE} you could {NOISE} pick it up really easily because(2) they were(2) afraid that(2) people would think it was a hoax basically so they made it really easy to {BREATH} find (StevenJohnson_2010G-821.76-830.28-F0_M-S110)
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 831.40 836.78 <o,f0,male> so <sil> these two guys are(2) sitting there listening to this signal and(2) {NOISE} people start kind of coming into the(2) office and saying wow that's pretty cool <sil> (StevenJohnson_2010G-831.40-836.78-F0_M-S110)

StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 871.04 876.15 <o,f0,male> and(2) then {SMACK} they played around with(2) it a little bit more and they talked to a couple of their colleagues who had other kind of {SMACK} specialties <sil> (StevenJohnson_2010G-871.04-876.15-F0_M-S110)
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 880.88 893.37 <o,f0,male> to figure out the points at <sil> which {SMACK} the satellite is closest to(3) our antennae and the points at <sil> which it's farthest away {BREATH} that's pretty <sil> cool {BREATH} and <sil> eventually(2) they get permission this is all a little side project that {NOISE} hadn't been officially part of their job description <sil> (StevenJohnson_2010G-880.88-893.37-F0_M-S110)

StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 932.14 937.93 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} could {NOISE} you go the other way <sil> could you figure out {UH} an unknown location on the ground if you knew(2) the location of the satellite <sil> (StevenJohnson_2010G-932.14-937.93-F0_M-S110)

StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 954.80 965.66 <o,f0,male> it's really(2) hard to figure out how to get your(2) missile so that it will land right on top of moscow {BREATH} if you don't(2) know(2) where the submarine is in the middle of the pacific ocean {BREATH} so we're(3) thinking we could throw up a bunch of satellites {BREATH} (StevenJohnson_2010G-954.80-965.66-F0_M-S110)
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 966.79 972.06 <o,f0,male> use(2) it to track {NOISE} our submarines and figure out their location in the middle of the(2) ocean {BREATH} could you work on that problem <sil> (StevenJohnson_2010G-966.79-972.06-F0_M-S110)
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 972.70 974.96 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} and(2) <sil> that's how {BREATH} gps was born <sil> (StevenJohnson_2010G-972.70-974.96-F0_M-S110)
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 976.35 984.78 <o,f0,male> thirty(2) years(2) later <sil> ronald reagan actually(4) {BREATH} opened it up and(2) made it an(2) open platform {UM} that(2) anybody could kind of build upon and anybody could come along and <sil> build new(2) technology <sil> (StevenJohnson_2010G-976.35-984.78-F0_M-S110)

StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 993.90 1003.99 <o,f0,male> now i guarantee you {NOISE} certainly half of this room if not more {BREATH} has a device {SMACK} sitting in their pocket right now that(2) is talking to one(2) of these satellites {BREATH} in outer space {SMACK} and i bet you {SMACK} <sil> (StevenJohnson_2010G-993.90-1003.99-F0_M-S110)
