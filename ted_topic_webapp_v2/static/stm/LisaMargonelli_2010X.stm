LisaMargonelli_2010X 1 LisaMargonelli_2010X 708.76 718.03 <o,f0,female> the <sil> other place {NOISE} that is sort of supporting our dependence {NOISE} on(2) oil and(2) our increased {UM} consumption {SMACK} is {BREATH} the gulf of mexico which was not part of the moratoriums <sil> (LisaMargonelli_2010X-708.76-718.03-F0_F-S115)
LisaMargonelli_2010X 1 LisaMargonelli_2010X 718.28 732.77 <o,f0,female> now what's(2) happened in the gulf of mexico as you can(2) see this is the minerals management diagram of {UH} wells for(2) gas and(2) oil {SMACK} it's become this intense <sil> industrialized zone {SMACK} it doesn't have(2) the same resonance for us that the(2) arctic(2) national wildlife refuge has {BREATH} but it should i mean it's a bird sanctuary <sil> (LisaMargonelli_2010X-718.28-732.77-F0_F-S115)

LisaMargonelli_2010X 1 LisaMargonelli_2010X 742.16 749.91 <o,f0,female> and(2) a lot of our marine terminals as(2) well {BREATH} so the people of the gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us {BREATH} through {BREATH} a less clean environment <sil> (LisaMargonelli_2010X-742.16-749.91-F0_F-S115)
LisaMargonelli_2010X 1 LisaMargonelli_2010X 750.86 758.76 <o,f0,female> and(2) finally american(3) families(2) also pay a(2) price for(2) oil {BREATH} now on(2) the one(2) hand the price at the pump is not really very high when(3) you consider the <sil> actual cost of the(2) oil {SMACK} (LisaMargonelli_2010X-750.86-758.76-F0_F-S115)
LisaMargonelli_2010X 1 LisaMargonelli_2010X 759.13 766.84 <o,f0,female> but on the(2) <sil> other hand {SMACK} the fact that(2) people have(2) no other transit {SMACK} options {SMACK} means <sil> that they pay a large amount of their <sil> income {NOISE} into(2) <sil> (LisaMargonelli_2010X-759.13-766.84-F0_F-S115)

LisaMargonelli_2010X 1 LisaMargonelli_2010X 797.78 809.62 <o,f0,female> so what i'm(2) going to talk to you about <sil> now {UH} is {NOISE} what(2) do we have(2) to do this time what are the laws what(2) do we have(2) to do {SMACK} to keep ourselves focused(2) one(2) thing is we need to stay away from the theater we need to stay away from the moratoriums (LisaMargonelli_2010X-797.78-809.62-F0_F-S115)
LisaMargonelli_2010X 1 LisaMargonelli_2010X 809.84 817.69 <o,f0,female> {NOISE} we need to(3) focus(2) really(2) back {NOISE} again {BREATH} on the molecules <sil> the moratoriums are fine {BREATH} but <sil> we do need to focus(2) on the molecules <sil> on the(2) <sil> oil <sil> (LisaMargonelli_2010X-809.84-817.69-F0_F-S115)
LisaMargonelli_2010X 1 LisaMargonelli_2010X 818.35 829.40 <o,f0,female> one(2) of the things that we {NOISE} also need to do is we need to try to(2) not kind of {BREATH} fool ourselves into thinking {SMACK} that you can(2) have(2) a green world before(2) you {NOISE} reduce(3) the amount of <sil> oil that we use(2) we need to focus on reducing(3) the(2) {UH} (LisaMargonelli_2010X-818.35-829.40-F0_F-S115)

LisaMargonelli_2010X 1 LisaMargonelli_2010X 874.78 883.83 <o,f0,female> we need to make the gas price better reflect(2) the real cost of <sil> oil {BREATH} and we need to(2) shift subsidies(2) from(2) the(2) {NOISE} oil industry {SMACK} which is {NOISE} at {NOISE} least ten billion dollars a year <sil> (LisaMargonelli_2010X-874.78-883.83-F0_F-S115)
