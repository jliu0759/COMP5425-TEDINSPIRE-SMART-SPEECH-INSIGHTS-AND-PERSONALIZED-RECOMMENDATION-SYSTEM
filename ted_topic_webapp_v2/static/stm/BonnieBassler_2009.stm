BonnieBassler_2009 1 BonnieBassler_2009 691.11 701.18 <o,f0,female> {NOISE} then again we turn to(2) chemistry(2) {BREATH} and we <sil> figured out what this generic molecule is {NOISE} that was the pink <sil> ovals on my last slide {BREATH} this is {SMACK} it {NOISE} it's a very small five {SMACK} carbon molecule (BonnieBassler_2009-691.11-701.18-F0_F-S10)
BonnieBassler_2009 1 BonnieBassler_2009 701.66 715.16 <o,f0,female> what(2) the(2) important thing is that we learned {NOISE} is that(2) <sil> every(2) bacterium has exactly the same {NOISE} enzyme <sil> and makes {SMACK} exactly the same molecule {BREATH} so they're {COUGH} all {NOISE} using this molecule for(2) <sil> interspecies communication {BREATH} this is the bacterial <sil> esperanto <sil> (BonnieBassler_2009-701.66-715.16-F0_F-S10)

BonnieBassler_2009 1 BonnieBassler_2009 717.28 730.34 <o,f0,female> we got that far we {SMACK} started(2) to(3) {NOISE} learn that(2) bacteria can talk to each other with <sil> this chemical language(2) <sil> but what we started <sil> to(2) think is that(2) <sil> maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well {COUGH} i've {NOISE} told you that(2) bacteria do have(2) all these social behaviors {NOISE} they {BREATH} communicate <sil> (BonnieBassler_2009-717.28-730.34-F0_F-S10)
BonnieBassler_2009 1 BonnieBassler_2009 730.67 742.67 <o,f0,female> with(2) these molecules {NOISE} of course i've {UH} also told you that one(2) of the important things they do {COUGH} is to(2) initiate pathogenicity <sil> using quorum sensing {BREATH} we thought what(2) if {NOISE} we made these <sil> bacteria so they can't <sil> talk <sil> or(2) they can't hear <sil> (BonnieBassler_2009-730.67-742.67-F0_F-S10)

BonnieBassler_2009 1 BonnieBassler_2009 771.45 783.88 <o,f0,female> we {NOISE} thought well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications just make these <sil> bacteria {BREATH} so they can't <sil> talk <sil> they can't <sil> count <sil> and they don't(2) know(2) to launch <sil> virulence {BREATH} and so that's exactly what we've <sil> done and we've sort of taken two strategies <sil> (BonnieBassler_2009-771.45-783.88-F0_F-S10)
BonnieBassler_2009 1 BonnieBassler_2009 784.16 798.54 <o,f0,female> <sil> the first one {NOISE} is we've targeted <sil> the(2) <sil> intraspecies communication system {BREATH} so we <sil> made molecules that look kind of {SMACK} like the real molecules which you saw {BREATH} but they're a little bit different {BREATH} and so they lock into those <sil> receptors <sil> and they {NOISE} jam {UH} recognition(2) <sil> of the real thing <sil> (BonnieBassler_2009-784.16-798.54-F0_F-S10)

BonnieBassler_2009 1 BonnieBassler_2009 849.63 861.78 <o,f0,female> <sil> what <sil> we've been(3) able to do {BREATH} is to give <sil> these virulent infections but we give them(2) in conjunction with our {NOISE} anti quorum sensing molecules so these are molecules that(2) <sil> look kind of like the real thing but they're a little bit different which(2) i've depicted on this slide <sil> (BonnieBassler_2009-849.63-861.78-F0_F-S10)
