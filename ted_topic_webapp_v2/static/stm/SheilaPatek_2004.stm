SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 740.22 741.79 <o,f0,female> {UH} so {BREATH} this is a potent (SheilaPatek_2004-740.22-741.79-F0_F-S120)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 744.20 745.53 <o,f0,female> in fluid(2) systems {COUGH} <sil> (SheilaPatek_2004-744.20-745.53-F0_F-S120)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 746.36 754.41 <o,f0,female> and(2) {NOISE} just to sort of take it one(2) step <sil> further i'm {UM} going to(2) show you <sil> the mantis shrimp approaching {UH} the snail {SMACK} this is taken at {UH} twenty(2) thousand(2) frames <sil> per second (SheilaPatek_2004-746.36-754.41-F0_F-S100)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 754.72 765.84 <o,f0,female> and(2) i have(2) to give full credit to the bbc cameraman <sil> tim green for(2) setting this shot {UH} up {BREATH} because(2) i {UH} could never have done this in a million years {BREATH} one(2) {UM} of {NOISE} the benefits of {UM} working with(2) professional {BREATH} cameramen <sil> (SheilaPatek_2004-754.72-765.84-F0_F-S100)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 773.77 779.97 <o,f0,female> so {NOISE} really {UH} just an amazing image(2) {SMACK} slowed down <sil> extremely {UM} to(2) extremely slow speeds {BREATH} (SheilaPatek_2004-773.77-779.97-F0_F-S100)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 780.47 789.97 <o,f0,female> and(2) again we can(2) see it in slightly different form <sil> there {UM} with the bubble forming {BREATH} and collapsing {UM} between those two surfaces(2) in fact you might have even seen {NOISE} some {BREATH} cavitation going(2) up the(2) edge of the {NOISE} (SheilaPatek_2004-780.47-789.97-F0_F-S100)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 78.68 82.52 <o,f0,female> so mantis shrimp come in two varieties <sil> there are spearers {SMACK} and smashers (SheilaPatek_2004-78.68-82.52-F0_F-S11)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 792.43 806.28 <o,f0,female> so {UH} to solve this quandary of the two {SMACK} force peaks what(2) i think was going(2) on(2) is that first impact is actually(3) the limb {SMACK} hitting the load cell {BREATH} and the second impact is actually(4) the collapse of the cavitation bubble {BREATH} and these animals may very well be making use of not only the force (SheilaPatek_2004-792.43-806.28-F0_F-S1)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 817.53 822.60 <o,f0,female> so really fascinating {SMACK} double whammy(2) so to speak {UM} from(2) these {NOISE} animals <sil> (SheilaPatek_2004-817.53-822.60-F0_F-S1)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 823.15 834.18 <o,f0,female> so one(2) question i often get {NOISE} after this talk so i figured i'd answer it now {SMACK} is well what(2) happens to(2) the(2) animal {SMACK} because(2) {UH} obviously if it's breaking snails the poor limb must be {SMACK} disintegrating and indeed it does {NOISE} (SheilaPatek_2004-823.15-834.18-F0_F-S1)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 82.62 89.21 <o,f0,female> and(2) this is a spearing {BREATH} mantis shrimp or stomatopod {BREATH} and he(2) lives(2) in the sand {SMACK} and he catches(2) things {NOISE} that {UM} go by {NOISE} (SheilaPatek_2004-82.62-89.21-F0_F-S101)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 844.88 855.03 <o,f0,female> is that you have(2) {SMACK} to molt <sil> and every(2) three months or(2) so these animals molt {BREATH} and they build a new limb and it's no problem {SMACK} very {COUGH} very {NOISE} convenient solution to that particular(2) problem {BREATH} (SheilaPatek_2004-844.88-855.03-F0_F-S1)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 858.88 860.76 <o,f0,female> like to end on sort of a wacky note <sil> (SheilaPatek_2004-858.88-860.76-F0_F-S101)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 865.15 867.56 <o,f0,female> maybe {NOISE} this is all wacky to {COUGH} folks like {COUGH} you {COUGH} (SheilaPatek_2004-865.15-867.56-F0_F-S138)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 870.30 879.55 <o,f0,female> {UH} so the saddles that saddle shaped spring {NOISE} has actually(4) been well known {BREATH} to(3) biologists for(2) a long time not as a spring {BREATH} but as(3) a visual signal <sil> (SheilaPatek_2004-870.30-879.55-F0_F-S120)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 891.22 901.45 <o,f0,female> of visual signals <sil> on {BREATH} what's(2) {UM} really {NOISE} in all species their spring {BREATH} and <sil> i think {NOISE} one(2) explanation for(2) this could be {NOISE} going back to the molting phenomenon <sil> (SheilaPatek_2004-891.22-901.45-F0_F-S1)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 901.75 910.91 <o,f0,female> so these animals <sil> go into a molting period {SMACK} where they're <sil> unable to strike <sil> their bodies become very soft(2) {BREATH} and {COUGH} they're {UH} literally unable to strike or they'll self destruct this is (SheilaPatek_2004-901.75-910.91-F0_F-S1)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 90.49 92.68 <o,f0,female> so {UM} a quick {NOISE} strike {COUGH} like <sil> that (SheilaPatek_2004-90.49-92.68-F0_F-S15)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 912.61 913.17 <o,f0,female> for(2) real <sil> (SheilaPatek_2004-912.61-913.17-F0_F-S100)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 913.82 927.97 <o,f0,female> and(2) {BREATH} what they do {BREATH} is up until that time {NOISE} period when(4) they can't strike {BREATH} they become really(2) obnoxious {SMACK} and awful(2) and they strike everything in sight it doesn't(2) matter <sil> who or(2) what {BREATH} and the second <sil> they get into that time {BREATH} point when(4) they can't {BREATH} strike any more <sil> <sil> (SheilaPatek_2004-913.82-927.97-F0_F-S100)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 929.08 940.75 <o,f0,female> <sil> just(2) signal <sil> they wave their legs around {SMACK} and it's one of the classic {NOISE} examples in animal behavior {UH} of bluffing <sil> it's a {UM} well {NOISE} established fact of these animals that(2) they actually(4) bluff they can't actually(4) strike <sil> but they pretend to(3) {SMACK} (SheilaPatek_2004-929.08-940.75-F0_F-S100)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 941.34 953.18 <o,f0,female> very {NOISE} curious about whether {BREATH} those colored dots {BREATH} in the center(2) of the saddles are {UH} conveying some kind of information(2) about <sil> their {BREATH} ability to strike or their strike force and something about the <sil> time period in the molting cycle <sil> (SheilaPatek_2004-941.34-953.18-F0_F-S100)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 953.65 960.35 <o,f0,female> {UH} so <sil> sort of an interesting(4) {COUGH} strange fact {COUGH} to find a(2) {NOISE} visual {NOISE} structure right in the middle of <sil> their spring <sil> (SheilaPatek_2004-953.65-960.35-F0_F-S100)
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 961.79 969.10 <o,f0,female> so to conclude {COUGH} i <sil> mostly(2) {NOISE} want to(3) {NOISE} acknowledge(2) my {NOISE} two collaborators wyatt korff and(2) roy caldwell who worked <sil> closely with(2) me on this <sil> (SheilaPatek_2004-961.79-969.10-F0_F-S100)
