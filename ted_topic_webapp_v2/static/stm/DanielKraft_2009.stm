DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 112.90 121.58 <o,f0,male> and {NOISE} the marrow miner the way it works {SMACK} is {NOISE} shown here {SMACK} our standard see through patient instead of {SMACK} entering the bone <sil> dozens of times {BREATH} we enter just once into the front of the hip or(2) the back of the {NOISE} (DanielKraft_2009-112.90-121.58-F0_M-S4)
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 122.19 135.04 <o,f0,male> and {NOISE} we {SMACK} have(2) a flexible powered catheter with a special wire loop tip that(2) stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow {BREATH} and follows the contours of the hip as it moves around(2) {BREATH} so it enables(2) you to(2) very rapidly {SMACK} aspirate or(2) suck out rich {NOISE} bone marrow very quickly through one(2) hole {BREATH} (DanielKraft_2009-122.19-135.04-F0_M-S4)
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 135.41 145.44 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} we can(2) do multiple passes through that same <sil> entry {SMACK} no robots required {BREATH} and {UH} so very quickly bob {UH} can(2) just(2) get one puncture(2) <sil> local anesthesia {BREATH} and do this harvest {SMACK} as an outpatient <sil> (DanielKraft_2009-135.41-145.44-F0_M-S4)
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 170.85 180.88 <o,f0,male> two passes here in the same patient from the same hole {BREATH} this {UM} was {NOISE} done under local anesthesia as(2) an <sil> outpatient {BREATH} and we got again about three to(2) six times {SMACK} more stem cells <sil> than the standard approach {BREATH} done on the same patient <sil> (DanielKraft_2009-170.85-180.88-F0_M-S4)
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 181.31 189.44 <o,f0,male> so why should you care {BREATH} bone marrow is a very rich source {SMACK} of adult(2) stem cells {BREATH} you all know(2) about {UH} embryonic stem cells they've got great potential but haven't yet <sil> entered(2) clinical(2) trials <sil> (DanielKraft_2009-181.31-189.44-F0_M-S4)
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 19.39 27.83 <o,f0,male> i am a(2) {SMACK} pediatric cancer doctor {UM} and stem cell researcher at stanford <sil> university {SMACK} where(2) my clinical focus(2) has been(2) bone marrow transplantation <sil> (DanielKraft_2009-19.39-27.83-F0_M-S4)
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 219.71 229.72 <o,f0,male> it may encourage(2) more people to sign up to be potential(2) live saving bone marrow donors {BREATH} it may {NOISE} even {NOISE} enable you to bank {SMACK} your(2) own marrow stem cells when(4) you're {BREATH} younger and healthier to {NOISE} use(2) in the(2) future <sil> should you need it <sil> (DanielKraft_2009-219.71-229.72-F0_M-S4)
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 230.57 241.03 <o,f0,male> and ultimately {SMACK} and(2) here 's(3) a picture of our <sil> bone marrow transplant survivors {COUGH} who come together for(2) a reunion each year at stanford {BREATH} hopefully this technology {BREATH} will let us have(2) more of these survivors <sil> in the future <sil> thanks <sil> (DanielKraft_2009-230.57-241.03-F0_M-S4)
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 28.23 34.89 <o,f0,male> now <sil> inspired by <sil> jill bolte {NOISE} taylor last year i didn't(4) bring <sil> a(2) human brain {SMACK} but i did bring {SMACK} a(2) <sil> liter of bone marrow <sil> (DanielKraft_2009-28.23-34.89-F0_M-S4)
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 46.07 56.42 <o,f0,male> so <sil> a few years ago i'm(2) <sil> doing my <sil> transplant fellowship at stanford i'm(2) {SMACK} in the(2) operating room {NOISE} we have(2) bob here who is a {UH} volunteer donor {BREATH} we're sending his marrow across the country to save the life of a child (DanielKraft_2009-46.07-56.42-F0_M-S4)
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 57.96 70.96 <o,f0,male> so actually(4) how do we <sil> harvest this bone marrow well {UH} we have a whole o r team general anesthesia nurses(2) {BREATH} and {UM} another doctor across from me bob 's(3) on(2) the table and {BREATH} we take this sort of small needle <sil> you know(2) {UM} not too big {SMACK} and {COUGH} the way we do this is we basically {UM} (DanielKraft_2009-57.96-70.96-F0_M-S4)
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 72.57 83.17 <o,f0,male> the {UH} soft(2) tissue(2) and {BREATH} kind of punch it {NOISE} into(2) the hard bone into the tuchus that's a technical term {BREATH} and {UM} aspirate {SMACK} about {UH} ten mls of bone marrow out {BREATH} each time with(2) a syringe {SMACK} (DanielKraft_2009-72.57-83.17-F0_M-S4)
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 83.93 89.56 <o,f0,male> and {UH} hand it off to the nurse she squirts it into a tin {BREATH} hands it back to me {SMACK} and we do that again <sil> and again about <sil> (DanielKraft_2009-83.93-89.56-F0_M-S4)
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 90.33 95.31 <o,f0,male> two hundred times usually {BREATH} and by the(2) end of this my arm is sore i've got a callus on my hand let alone bob {SMACK} whose (DanielKraft_2009-90.33-95.31-F0_M-S4)
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 99.37 111.61 <o,f0,male> so <sil> i'm thinking <sil> you know(2) this <sil> procedure hasn't changed in about <sil> forty years {BREATH} and {COUGH} there {UM} is probably(2) a better way to(2) do this so {BREATH} i thought of a minimally invasive approach {BREATH} and(2) a new(2) device <sil> that we call {UH} the marrow miner <sil> this is it <sil> (DanielKraft_2009-99.37-111.61-F0_M-S4)
