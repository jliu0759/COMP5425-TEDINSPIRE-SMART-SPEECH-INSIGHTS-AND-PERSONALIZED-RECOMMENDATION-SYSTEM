PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 114.54 123.93 <o,f0,male> you get now a dna stapler instead {BREATH} these are(2) the kind of molecular programs that we want to be able to write but the problem is {BREATH} we <sil> don't know(2) the machine language(2) of proteins {BREATH} we don't have(2) a compiler for(2) proteins (PaulRothemund_2007-114.54-123.93-F0_M-S1)
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 124.20 134.35 <o,f0,male> so i've joined a growing band of people {BREATH} that(2) try to(2) make molecular spells using dna we use(2) dna because(2) it's cheaper it's {SMACK} easier to handle {BREATH} it's something that we understand really well we understand it so well in fact <sil> (PaulRothemund_2007-124.20-134.35-F0_M-S1)
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 13.41 21.77 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} there's {NOISE} an(2) {SMACK} ancient and universal concept that(2) words have(2) power {NOISE} that(2) spells {NOISE} exist {BREATH} and if {NOISE} we could only pronounce the right {COUGH} words {BREATH} then {SMACK} (PaulRothemund_2007-13.41-21.77-F0_M-S1)
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 134.59 147.04 <o,f0,male> that(2) {NOISE} we {SMACK} think we can {COUGH} actually(3) {BREATH} write {SMACK} programming languages(2) for(2) dna and have(2) molecular compilers {BREATH} so then we think we can(2) do that and my {BREATH} first {UM} question(2) {NOISE} doing this or(2) one of my questions doing this was how can(2) you make an arbitrary shape or(2) pattern out of dna <sil> (PaulRothemund_2007-134.59-147.04-F0_M-S1)
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 147.46 154.34 <o,f0,male> and(2) {UH} i decided {SMACK} to use(2) a type of dna {NOISE} origami where(2) you take a long strand of dna and fold it into whatever(2) {BREATH} shape or(2) pattern you might <sil> want <sil> (PaulRothemund_2007-147.46-154.34-F0_M-S1)
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 154.62 162.72 <o,f0,male> so here 's(3) a shape {BREATH} i actually(4) spent {NOISE} about a year {COUGH} in my home in my {UH} underwear coding {BREATH} like linus in that picture before {BREATH} and this program takes a(2) shape (PaulRothemund_2007-154.62-162.72-F0_M-S1)
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 195.62 208.04 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} and <sil> then add this long strand i was telling you about that i've stolen from a virus {BREATH} and then what(2) happens is you heat this {NOISE} whole thing up to(3) {BREATH} about boiling {BREATH} you cool it down {BREATH} to room temperature and <sil> as you do what(2) happens is those short strands they do the following thing <sil> (PaulRothemund_2007-195.62-208.04-F0_M-S1)
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 208.35 217.35 <o,f0,male> each one(2) of them binds that long strand {BREATH} in one place {BREATH} and then <sil> has a second half that(2) binds that long strand in a distant place and brings those two {BREATH} parts of the long strand (PaulRothemund_2007-208.35-217.35-F0_M-S1)
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 224.87 232.39 <o,f0,male> long strand into the shape that(2) you're looking for {BREATH} it'll approximate(2) that shape we do this for(2) real in the test tube(2) {BREATH} in each little drop of water you get fifty billion of these guys (PaulRothemund_2007-224.87-232.39-F0_M-S1)
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 22.61 32.30 <o,f0,male> you know(2) an(2) avalanche would come {BREATH} and wipe out the hobbits right {BREATH} so this is a very attractive idea {BREATH} because(2) we're very lazy {NOISE} like the sorcerer 's apprentice(2) or the world 's(3) greatest computer programmer <sil> (PaulRothemund_2007-22.61-32.30-F0_M-S1)
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 232.63 245.20 <o,f0,male> you can(2) look with(2) a microscope and(2) see them on(2) a surface {BREATH} and the neat thing is that(2) if you change the sequence and change the spell you just(2) change {BREATH} the sequence of the staples <sil> you can(2) make {UH} a molecule that looks like {NOISE} this {BREATH} and {COUGH} you know(2) he likes to hang out with his(2) {NOISE} (PaulRothemund_2007-232.63-245.20-F0_M-S1)
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 254.82 263.15 <o,f0,male> you can {NOISE} get <sil> arbitrary(2) patterns {NOISE} so on(2) a {UH} rectangle you can(2) paint {BREATH} patterns {UH} of {BREATH} north and south america {BREATH} or the words dna {BREATH} so <sil> (PaulRothemund_2007-254.82-263.15-F0_M-S1)

PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 68.48 81.91 <o,f0,male> the important thing is we can(2) write it in a high level language {BREATH} a computer magician {BREATH} can write this thing it can(2) be compiled into this {BREATH} into zeros and ones {BREATH} and {SMACK} pronounced by a computer and that's what(2) makes computers powerful these high level languages(2) that(2) can(2) be compiled {BREATH} and so <sil> (PaulRothemund_2007-68.48-81.91-F0_M-S1)
