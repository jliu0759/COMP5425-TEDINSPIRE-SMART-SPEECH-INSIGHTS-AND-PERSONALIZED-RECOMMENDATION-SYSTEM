BrianCox_2008 1 BrianCox_2008 86.93 96.67 <o,f0,male> see those <sil> metal bits there those are(2) <sil> huge magnets that bend {NOISE} electrically(2) charged particles(2) {SMACK} so it can(2) measure how fast they're traveling {SMACK} this is a picture about a year ago <sil> (BrianCox_2008-86.93-96.67-F0_M-S101)

BrianCox_2008 1 BrianCox_2008 97.29 111.17 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} those {NOISE} magnets are in there {NOISE} and(2) again(2) an eu standard size <sil> real person {BREATH} so you get some sense of the scale <sil> and it's in there {UM} that those mini big bangs will be created(2) {BREATH} sometime in the summer this year {SMACK} and actually(4) this morning i got an(2) email saying that we've just finished today <sil> (BrianCox_2008-97.29-111.17-F0_M-S101)
