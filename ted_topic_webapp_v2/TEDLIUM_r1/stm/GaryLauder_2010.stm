GaryLauder_2010 1 GaryLauder_2010 162.46 170.84 <o,f0,male> so it makes one(2) wonder <sil> why {NOISE} is it there <sil> i mean <sil> why is there that stop sign in {NOISE} each direction(2) <sil> because(2) it {SMACK} is saving lives {BREATH} so is there a better way to(3) accomplish that goal <sil> (GaryLauder_2010-162.46-170.84-F0_M-S23)
GaryLauder_2010 1 GaryLauder_2010 171.09 181.09 <o,f0,male> the answer is to(3) enable(2) cars to come {NOISE} in from that side road safely because(2) {NOISE} there are(2) a lot of people who might live(2) up there and if they're {NOISE} waiting forever a {NOISE} long queue could form {UM} because(2) the cars aren't(2) slowing down on(2) the main road <sil> (GaryLauder_2010-171.09-181.09-F0_M-S23)
