BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 650.23 658.80 <o,f0,female> the problem is {BREATH} the(2) efficiency {BREATH} is one hundredth {NOISE} of one percent {BREATH} because {UH} you're heating {NOISE} all the metal of the chamber <sil> and then <sil> cooling all the metal of the chamber <sil> each time <sil> (BillGross_2003-650.23-658.80-F0_F-S105)
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 673.25 684.63 <o,f0,female> you move that up and(2) down with(2) a little bit of energy {BREATH} but now you're(2) {NOISE} only shifting the(2) air down to the hot end <sil> and up to the cold end <sil> down to the hot end and up to the cold end {BREATH} so {NOISE} now {NOISE} you're(2) {BREATH} <sil> (BillGross_2003-673.25-684.63-F0_F-S105)

BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 697.20 707.09 <o,f0,female> i'm still heating the air every time and cooling the air every time {BREATH} what about {NOISE} if i put {NOISE} a(2) thermal sponge {BREATH} in the middle {BREATH} in the passageway(2) {BREATH} between where(2) the air has to move between hot and cold <sil> (BillGross_2003-697.20-707.09-F0_F-S105)

BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 715.96 724.78 <o,f0,female> it puts some heat into the sponge {BREATH} and then when(4) the(2) air comes back after it's {NOISE} been cooled {NOISE} it picks up that heat again {BREATH} so you're reusing your(2) energy <sil> five or(2) six times <sil> (BillGross_2003-715.96-724.78-F0_F-S105)

BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 770.92 784.20 <o,f0,female> so this is the(2) engine {NOISE} it's {UM} just a small cylinder down here {NOISE} which(2) holds the generator inside and all the linkage(2) {BREATH} and it's the(2) <sil> hot {NOISE} cap the hot cylinder on the top {BREATH} this part gets hot {BREATH} this part is {SMACK} cool <sil> and electricity comes out <sil> (BillGross_2003-770.92-784.20-F0_F-S105)
