LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 712.62 721.30 <o,f0,male> the first things that(2) happened was {BREATH} we started going around to fragrance companies {SMACK} asking <sil> for what(2) they needed because(2) <sil> of course <sil> if you could calculate smell <sil> (LucaTurin_2005-712.62-721.30-F0_M-S101)
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 721.55 732.88 <o,f0,male> you don a t need chemists {BREATH} you need a computer {COUGH} a mac will do it if you know(2) how to program {BREATH} the thing right {UH} ok {BREATH} so you can(2) {NOISE} try a thousand molecules {BREATH} you can(2) try ten thousand molecules {UH} in a weekend {BREATH} <sil> (LucaTurin_2005-721.55-732.88-F0_M-S101)
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 72.39 74.88 <o,f0,male> so what(2) you a {NOISE} re smelling is {SMACK} several hundred molecules <sil> (LucaTurin_2005-72.39-74.88-F0_M-S1)
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 747.23 754.05 <o,f0,male> you {NOISE} cannot(2) {NOISE} make a coumarin he <sil> says(2) to me {COUGH} i bet {NOISE} you cannot make a coumarin now {NOISE} coumarin is a very common {NOISE} <sil> (LucaTurin_2005-747.23-754.05-F0_M-S101)
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 755.19 762.98 <o,f0,male> a material {NOISE} in fragrance {BREATH} which {SMACK} is derived from a bean that comes from south america {SMACK} and it is the(2) {NOISE} classic {SMACK} synthetic <sil> aroma chemical <sil> (LucaTurin_2005-755.19-762.98-F0_M-S101)
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 771.02 778.97 <o,f0,male> the problem is {SMACK} it {SMACK} a(2) <sil> s a carcinogen <sil> so nobody likes <sil> particularly(2) to(3) <sil> you know(2) <sil> aftershave {COUGH} with(2) carcinogens {COUGH} (LucaTurin_2005-771.02-778.97-F0_M-S101)
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 780.80 790.42 <o,f0,male> there are some reckless people but {COUGH} it <sil> a {COUGH} s not worth it <sil> ok {BREATH} so they asked us to make a new(2) coumarin {BREATH} and so we started doing calculations {BREATH} and the first thing you do is you calculate (LucaTurin_2005-780.80-790.42-F0_M-S101)
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 790.64 799.17 <o,f0,male> the vibrational spectrum of coumarin and you smooth it out {BREATH} so that(2) you have(2) a nice {BREATH} picture <sil> of what(2) {NOISE} this sort of <sil> chord so to speak of coumarin {NOISE} is {BREATH} (LucaTurin_2005-790.64-799.17-F0_M-S101)
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 79.93 87.56 <o,f0,male> do not get the(2) impression that this is very subjective {BREATH} you are all smelling {BREATH} pretty much the same thing <sil> ok smell has this reputation of being {BREATH} (LucaTurin_2005-79.93-87.56-F0_M-S1)
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 799.97 807.36 <o,f0,male> and(2) then <sil> you start cranking {BREATH} the computer {BREATH} to find other molecules {SMACK} related or unrelated that have(2) the same vibrations <sil> <sil> (LucaTurin_2005-799.97-807.36-F0_M-S101)
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 808.72 811.61 <o,f0,male> we actually(3) in this case i a m <sil> sorry to say {SMACK} <sil> (LucaTurin_2005-808.72-811.61-F0_M-S101)
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 812.48 825.50 <o,f0,male> it happened it was serendipitous {SMACK} because(2) <sil> i {UM} got a phone call from our chief {NOISE} chemist and he(2) said look {BREATH} i <sil> a <sil> ve just found this such a beautiful reaction {BREATH} that {NOISE} even if this compound doesn a t smell of coumarin i want to do it it a(2) s just such a nifty {BREATH} (LucaTurin_2005-812.48-825.50-F0_M-S101)
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 826.09 837.07 <o,f0,male> one(2) {NOISE} step i mean chemists(2) have(2) <sil> weird {NOISE} minds {BREATH} one step {COUGH} ninety percent yield {BREATH} you know(2) {BREATH} and you get this lovely {BREATH} crystalline compound {UH} let us try it and i said {NOISE} first of all let me do the calculation <sil> (LucaTurin_2005-826.09-837.07-F0_M-S101)
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 837.51 845.04 <o,f0,male> {UM} on(2) <sil> that {COUGH} compound <sil> bottom right <sil> which {SMACK} is related(3) to(3) coumarin but has an extra {NOISE} pentagon(2) inserted into(2) the molecule <sil> (LucaTurin_2005-837.51-845.04-F0_M-S101)
