PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 734.38 743.87 <o,f0,male> so what we've done {NOISE} is we've succeeded(2) in making something {NOISE} much bigger than a(2) dna origami {BREATH} by combining dna origami {BREATH} with(2) tiles {BREATH} and the neat thing about it is is that it's {UH} also <sil> (PaulRothemund_2008-734.38-743.87-F0_M-S4)
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 745.08 758.43 <o,f0,male> you can(2) just change a couple of the dna strands in this binary representation {BREATH} and you'll get {BREATH} ninety six rather(2) than(2) thirty two {BREATH} and if you do that {BREATH} the origami 's(3) the same size {BREATH} but the resulting square that(2) you get {BREATH} is three times bigger <sil> <sil> (PaulRothemund_2008-745.08-758.43-F0_M-S4)
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 759.24 764.38 <o,f0,male> so this sort of recapitulates what(2) i was telling you about development {BREATH} you have(2) {BREATH} a very sensitive(2) <sil> (PaulRothemund_2008-759.24-764.38-F0_M-S4)

PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 774.47 785.08 <o,f0,male> now {BREATH} this <sil> using counting(2) {BREATH} to(3) compute and build these kinds(2) of things by this kind of developmental process(2) {BREATH} is {UH} something that also has bearing {BREATH} on craig venter 's(2) question <sil> (PaulRothemund_2008-774.47-785.08-F0_M-S4)
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 785.34 794.17 <o,f0,male> so you can(2) ask {SMACK} how many dna strands are(2) required to build {UH} a square of a given(2) size {BREATH} if we wanted to make a square of size ten {BREATH} one(2) hundred(3) {NOISE} or {UH} one(2) thousand {BREATH} (PaulRothemund_2008-785.34-794.17-F0_M-S4)

PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 805.63 814.72 <o,f0,male> but if we use(2) a little computation {BREATH} we use {NOISE} origami {BREATH} plus some tiles that(2) count {BREATH} then we can get away with using one(2) hundred two hundred {NOISE} or(2) three hundred dna {NOISE} <sil> (PaulRothemund_2008-805.63-814.72-F0_M-S4)
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 846.11 856.41 <o,f0,male> so {NOISE} if you <sil> affix(2) some wires(2) and switches to those tiles rather(2) than(2) to the {BREATH} staple strands you affix(2) them to the tiles {BREATH} then they'll self assemble the somewhat(2) complicated circuits the de(3) multiplexer circuits that(2) you need (PaulRothemund_2008-846.11-856.41-F0_M-S4)

PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 89.07 101.48 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} you could end up with(2) a thousand dollars(2) {BREATH} so these small {UM} changes(2) {BREATH} are things that i think that(2) {BREATH} they indicate to us that(2) a complicated computation in development {BREATH} is {NOISE} underlying these amplified {NOISE} large changes so {SMACK} now <sil> (PaulRothemund_2008-89.07-101.48-F0_M-S4)
