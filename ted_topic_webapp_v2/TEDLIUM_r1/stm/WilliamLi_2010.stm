WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 630.33 634.15 <o,f0,male> so i started(2) asking myself <sil> why haven't we been(2) able to do <sil> better <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-630.33-634.15-F0_M-S118)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 635.55 644.61 <o,f0,male> and(2) the(2) answer <sil> to me {NOISE} is obvious <sil> we're treating cancer too late in the game {SMACK} when(3) it's already established <sil> and <sil> oftentimes it's already(2) spread or metastasized <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-635.55-644.61-F0_M-S118)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 63.56 72.79 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} now {NOISE} the remarkable thing about blood vessels {SMACK} is that they have(2) this ability {SMACK} to adapt to(3) whatever(2) environment they're growing in for(2) example <sil> in the liver they form channels to detoxify the blood {UH} <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-63.56-72.79-F0_M-S119)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 644.91 653.86 <o,f0,male> and(2) {NOISE} as(2) {COUGH} a doctor <sil> i know(2) <sil> that once a disease {SMACK} progresses(2) to an(2) advanced stage <sil> achieving a(2) cure <sil> can be <sil> difficult <sil> if <sil> not {NOISE} impossible <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-644.91-653.86-F0_M-S118)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 655.03 659.95 <o,f0,male> so i went back to the biology <sil> of angiogenesis <sil> and {SMACK} started thinking <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-655.03-659.95-F0_M-S118)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 661.03 665.34 <o,f0,male> could {UH} the(2) {NOISE} answer to cancer <sil> be <sil> preventing(2) <sil> angiogenesis <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-661.03-665.34-F0_M-S118)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 665.99 670.54 <o,f0,male> beating {NOISE} cancer at its own game <sil> so the cancers could never become <sil> dangerous <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-665.99-670.54-F0_M-S118)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 671.91 679.35 <o,f0,male> this could help <sil> healthy people <sil> as well as(2) people who 've already(2) <sil> beaten cancer <sil> once or twice {BREATH} and want to find a way to keep it from coming <sil> back (WilliamLi_2010-671.91-679.35-F0_M-S118)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 687.53 693.43 <o,f0,male> i saw that <sil> diet <sil> accounts for(2) thirty to thirty five percent {BREATH} of environmentally(2) caused cancers <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-687.53-693.43-F0_M-S103)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 694.60 700.28 <o,f0,male> now the(2) obvious thing {SMACK} is to think about what we could remove from our diet what(2) {NOISE} what(2) to strip out <sil> take away <sil> <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-694.60-700.28-F0_M-S103)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 700.85 709.29 <o,f0,male> but i actually(4) took a completely opposite(2) approach {SMACK} and began(2) asking <sil> what could we be <sil> adding to(3) our diet <sil> that's <sil> naturally antiangiogenic <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-700.85-709.29-F0_M-S103)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 709.80 718.55 <o,f0,male> could <sil> boost the body 's(2) defense system {NOISE} and <sil> beat <sil> back those blood vessels {BREATH} that are(2) feeding cancers <sil> in other words <sil> can we <sil> eat <sil> to(2) starve cancer <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-709.80-718.55-F0_M-S103)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 719.83 722.06 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} well the answer 's yes and i'm going to show you how <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-719.83-722.06-F0_M-S103)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 722.88 735.67 <o,f0,male> our search for this {BREATH} has taken us to(3) the market(2) <sil> the farm <sil> and to the spice cabinet(2) because(2) what we've discovered {BREATH} is that mother nature has laced a large number of {SMACK} foods and(2) beverages and(2) {NOISE} herbs {BREATH} with(2) naturally occurring {SMACK} inhibitors <sil> of <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-722.88-735.67-F0_M-S103)

WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 751.13 755.47 <o,f0,male> so let me show you what(2) happens when(3) we put in {SMACK} an extract <sil> from(2) {UH} red grapes <sil> the {UH} (WilliamLi_2010-751.13-755.47-F0_M-S103)

WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 759.73 763.51 <o,f0,male> this <sil> inhibits <sil> abnormal <sil> angiogenesis <sil> by sixty percent <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-759.73-763.51-F0_M-S103)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 767.96 770.39 <o,f0,male> it <sil> potently <sil> inhibits <sil> angiogenesis <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-767.96-770.39-F0_M-S118)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 774.11 782.27 <o,f0,male> and(2) here {COUGH} is {NOISE} a growing list <sil> of our {NOISE} antiangiogenic <sil> foods and beverages that we're interested(3) in studying <sil> and for(2) {NOISE} each <sil> food type <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-774.11-782.27-F0_M-S103)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 782.80 796.53 <o,f0,male> we believe {COUGH} there is different potencies <sil> within different strains and(2) varietals {BREATH} and(2) we want to measure this <sil> because(2) {UH} well <sil> while you're {NOISE} eating a strawberry {BREATH} or drinking tea {SMACK} why not select the one(2) that's most potent <sil> for preventing cancer <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-782.80-796.53-F0_M-S103)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 797.47 799.72 <o,f0,male> so here are {NOISE} <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-797.47-799.72-F0_M-S103)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 802.55 806.61 <o,f0,male> chinese jasmine(2) japanese sencha {UH} earl grey and a special blend that(2) we prepared {SMACK} <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-802.55-806.61-F0_M-S103)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 807.10 809.90 <o,f0,male> and(2) you can see <sil> clearly <sil> that the teas vary {NOISE} in (WilliamLi_2010-807.10-809.90-F0_M-S103)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 810.24 813.15 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} potency <sil> from less potent {SMACK} to more potent <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-810.24-813.15-F0_M-S118)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 814.17 818.83 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} but {NOISE} what's(2) very cool <sil> is when(3) we actually(3) combined the two less potent teas together <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-814.17-818.83-F0_M-S118)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 819.45 823.29 <o,f0,male> the combination {SMACK} the blend <sil> is more potent <sil> than <sil> either one(2) {NOISE} (WilliamLi_2010-819.45-823.29-F0_M-S118)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 824.80 826.22 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} this means <sil> there's food <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-824.80-826.22-F0_M-S118)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 833.27 843.49 <o,f0,male> tumor angiogenesis {BREATH} represented here in a black bar <sil> and using this system we can test the potency of cancer drugs {SMACK} so the shorter the bar <sil> less angiogenesis <sil> that's good <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-833.27-843.49-F0_M-S103)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 844.41 854.24 <o,f0,male> and(2) here are(2) some {UH} common drugs <sil> that have(2) been(2) associated(2) with {SMACK} reducing the risk of cancer <sil> in people <sil> statins <sil> nonsteroidal <sil> anti(2) inflammatory drugs and a few others <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-844.41-854.24-F0_M-S103)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 854.73 856.38 <o,f0,male> they inhibit angiogenesis too <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-854.73-856.38-F0_M-S103)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 857.36 861.96 <o,f0,male> and(2) here are the dietary factors <sil> going(2) head to head {BREATH} against these drugs <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-857.36-861.96-F0_M-S103)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 85.89 89.58 <o,f0,male> and(2) {NOISE} we {NOISE} get(2) most of these blood vessels <sil> when(3) we're actually(4) still in the womb <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-85.89-89.58-F0_M-S118)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 877.05 888.52 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} so imagine <sil> if we could create the world 's(3) first <sil> rating system <sil> in which we could score foods <sil> according to their <sil> antiangiogenic {SMACK} cancer preventative properties <sil> and that's what(2) we're doing <sil> right now <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-877.05-888.52-F0_M-S103)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 889.77 899.49 <o,f0,male> now i've shown you a bunch of lab data <sil> and {COUGH} so the real question(2) is what is the evidence <sil> in <sil> people <sil> that <sil> eating certain foods can reduce(2) <sil> angiogenesis <sil> in <sil> cancer <sil> <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-889.77-899.49-F0_M-S103)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 900.65 906.25 <o,f0,male> <sil> well the {NOISE} best example i know(2) is a study of seventy nine {SMACK} thousand men <sil> followed over twenty(2) years <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-900.65-906.25-F0_M-S103)

WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 916.61 922.13 <o,f0,male> now {COUGH} we know(2) that tomatoes(2) are(2) a good source of lycopene <sil> and lycopene <sil> is <sil> antiangiogenic {BREATH} <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-916.61-922.13-F0_M-S103)
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 934.40 943.62 <o,f0,male> so this human(2) study is a prime example <sil> of how {NOISE} antiangiogenic substances(2) <sil> present(2) in food and consumed at practical levels <sil> can {NOISE} impact <sil> on cancer <sil> (WilliamLi_2010-934.40-943.62-F0_M-S103)
