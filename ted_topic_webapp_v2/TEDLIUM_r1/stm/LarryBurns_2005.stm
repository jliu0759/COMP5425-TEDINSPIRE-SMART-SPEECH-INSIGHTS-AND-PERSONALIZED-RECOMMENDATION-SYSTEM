LarryBurns_2005 1 LarryBurns_2005 112.52 120.93 <o,f0,male> we wanted something that was really affordable {BREATH} the fuel cell looked great {BREATH} one <sil> tenth as many moving parts and a fuel cell propulsion system as(2) an(2) internal combustion engine (LarryBurns_2005-112.52-120.93-F0_M-S2)
LarryBurns_2005 1 LarryBurns_2005 130.13 141.55 <o,f0,male> so we embarked upon {UH} the reinvention around an(2) electrochemical engine the fuel cell {BREATH} hydrogen as the energy carrier {BREATH} first was(2) autonomy(2) {SMACK} autonomy(2) really set the vision for(2) where(2) we wanted(2) to head (LarryBurns_2005-130.13-141.55-F0_M-S2)
