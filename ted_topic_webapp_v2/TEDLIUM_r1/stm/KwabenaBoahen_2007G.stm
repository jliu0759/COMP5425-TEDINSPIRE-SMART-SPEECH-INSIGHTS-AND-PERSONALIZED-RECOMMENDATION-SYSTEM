KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 724.23 736.84 <o,f0,male> will give you the same kind of robust {UH} architecture that i described {SMACK} here {NOISE} is actually(3) {SMACK} what <sil> our(2) {UH} artificial eye {NOISE} looks like <sil> the(2) {NOISE} retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here <sil> (KwabenaBoahen_2007G-724.23-736.84-F0_M-S143)
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 737.47 747.46 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} and the chip {NOISE} i'm going to show you a video {BREATH} that {COUGH} the(2) silicon retina <sil> put out {UH} of its {NOISE} output <sil> when it was looking at kareem zaghloul {BREATH} who 's the student who designed <sil> this {NOISE} (KwabenaBoahen_2007G-737.47-747.46-F0_M-S143)
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 754.51 763.73 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} the retina chip <sil> extracts four different kinds of information(2) it extracts(2) regions {BREATH} with dark contrasts(2) <sil> which {NOISE} will show up on the video as red {SMACK} <sil> (KwabenaBoahen_2007G-754.51-763.73-F0_M-S143)
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 764.22 774.05 <o,f0,male> and it {NOISE} extracts <sil> regions with(2) white {NOISE} or light <sil> contrast which(2) will(2) show up on the video as <sil> green {SMACK} this {NOISE} is {NOISE} kareem 's(3) dark {UH} eyes and that's {UH} the white background that you see here {COUGH} <sil> (KwabenaBoahen_2007G-764.22-774.05-F0_M-S143)
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 774.61 786.37 <o,f0,male> and(2) then it also extracts <sil> movement <sil> when {SMACK} kareem moves his(2) head to the right <sil> you will see this blue activity(2) there it represents regions where the contrast {BREATH} is {NOISE} increasing in the image that's where {COUGH} it's going from dark <sil> to light <sil> (KwabenaBoahen_2007G-774.61-786.37-F0_M-S143)
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 786.79 796.70 <o,f0,male> and(2) you also see <sil> this yellow activity(2) which(2) represents regions where {BREATH} contrast <sil> is decreasing(2) it's going from {BREATH} light {NOISE} to dark {BREATH} and these four types of information(2) <sil> (KwabenaBoahen_2007G-786.79-796.70-F0_M-S143)
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 798.41 806.38 <o,f0,male> your {NOISE} optic {NOISE} nerve <sil> has(2) about a million fibers in it {SMACK} and nine hundred thousand of those fibers {NOISE} send {UH} these four types {NOISE} of information(2) <sil> (KwabenaBoahen_2007G-798.41-806.38-F0_M-S143)
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 806.66 812.55 <o,f0,male> so we are really(2) duplicating the kind of {UH} signals that you have(2) on(2) the(2) optic nerve <sil> what you notice(2) here is that these {BREATH} (KwabenaBoahen_2007G-806.66-812.55-F0_M-S143)
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 823.20 837.28 <o,f0,male> and(2) this is the same thing you see {SMACK} when people compress {SMACK} video to send they want to make it very sparse because(2) that file is smaller {BREATH} and this is what(2) the retina is doing and it's doing it just with the circuitry {SMACK} and how {NOISE} this network of neurons that are {NOISE} interacting(2) in there which(2) we've captured on(2) the chip <sil> (KwabenaBoahen_2007G-823.20-837.28-F0_M-S143)
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 838.90 851.19 <o,f0,male> the point that i want to make i'll show you {NOISE} up here so this <sil> image here is going to look like these ones {BREATH} but here i'll show you that we can reconstruct the(2) image <sil> so you <sil> know(2) you can {NOISE} almost recognize kareem in that <sil> top <sil> part {SMACK} there <sil> (KwabenaBoahen_2007G-838.90-851.19-F0_M-S143)
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 85.15 95.10 <o,f0,male> it's still not true <sil> the {BREATH} question(2) {UH} is {BREATH} why(2) {NOISE} aren't <sil> we {NOISE} really(2) seeing <sil> this kind of power {NOISE} in computers that we see in the brain <sil> (KwabenaBoahen_2007G-85.15-95.10-F0_M-S150)
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 862.15 869.92 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} yes so that's the(2) {NOISE} idea when(3) you stand still you just(2) see <sil> the {NOISE} light and dark contrasts but when(3) it's moving back and(2) forth {BREATH} the retina picks {UH} (KwabenaBoahen_2007G-862.15-869.92-F0_M-S143)
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 870.43 882.91 <o,f0,male> these changes and that's why you know(2) when(3) you're sitting here and something happens {NOISE} in your background you merely move your eyes to it {BREATH} there are these <sil> cells that detect change {SMACK} and {NOISE} you move your attention to it so those are very important for <sil> catching somebody who 's(3) {NOISE} (KwabenaBoahen_2007G-870.43-882.91-F0_M-S143)
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 884.56 894.01 <o,f0,male> let me just(2) end by saying that {SMACK} this is what(2) happens {BREATH} when you put africa(3) {NOISE} in a piano <sil> ok <sil> this is {COUGH} a steel drum here {BREATH} that has(2) been modified and that's what(2) {NOISE} (KwabenaBoahen_2007G-884.56-894.01-F0_M-S143)
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 921.69 926.69 <o,f0,male> like i said at the beginning i {NOISE} got my first computer when i was a teenager growing up <sil> in {UH} (KwabenaBoahen_2007G-921.69-926.69-F0_M-S153)
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 927.99 934.91 <o,f0,male> and {SMACK} i had this <sil> gut reaction that this was(2) the wrong way to do it it was very brute force it was very {NOISE} inelegant {BREATH} i don't {NOISE} think that (KwabenaBoahen_2007G-927.99-934.91-F0_M-S153)
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 935.74 942.32 <o,f0,male> that reaction {NOISE} if i'd grown up reading(2) all this science fiction <sil> hearing about rd <sil> two d two {UM} whatever it was called <sil> (KwabenaBoahen_2007G-935.74-942.32-F0_M-S153)
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 942.59 952.03 <o,f0,male> and(2) just(2) {SMACK} you know(2) buying into this hype {SMACK} about computers i was coming at it from a different perspective {BREATH} where {UH} i was bringing that different(2) perspective to bear on the problem and(2) i think a lot of people in africa <sil> (KwabenaBoahen_2007G-942.59-952.03-F0_M-S153)
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 952.57 961.31 <o,f0,male> this different perspective and(2) i think that's going to(2) impact technology {SMACK} and that's going to(2) impact how it's going to evolve {BREATH} and i think you're(2) going to be able to see use(2) that infusion to come up with new(2) things <sil> (KwabenaBoahen_2007G-952.57-961.31-F0_M-S153)
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 95.82 105.46 <o,f0,male> what(2) people didn't realize and i'm(2) just(2) beginning to realize right now is that we pay a(2) huge(2) price {BREATH} for the speed <sil> that <sil> we claim is a big {NOISE} advantage(2) of these computers {BREATH} <sil> (KwabenaBoahen_2007G-95.82-105.46-F0_M-S150)
