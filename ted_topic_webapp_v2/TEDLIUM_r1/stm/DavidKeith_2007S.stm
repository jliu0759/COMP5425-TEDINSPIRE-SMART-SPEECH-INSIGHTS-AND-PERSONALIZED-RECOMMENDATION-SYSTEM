DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 870.71 880.54 <o,f0,male> a very small amount of money would get us some {BREATH} many of us <sil> maybe now me think {NOISE} we should do that {BREATH} but i have a lot of reservations <sil> my reservations are(2) principally about the {NOISE} moral {SMACK} hazard problem {SMACK} <sil> (DavidKeith_2007S-870.71-880.54-F0_M-S104)
