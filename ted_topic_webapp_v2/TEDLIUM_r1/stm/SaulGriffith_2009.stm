SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 122.07 131.82 <o,f0,male> wrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored in the journal of energy {SMACK} about how to use {BREATH} basically an airplane on a piece of string {BREATH} to generate enormous amounts of electricity {SMACK} <sil> (SaulGriffith_2009-122.07-131.82-F0_M-S3)
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 132.26 142.01 <o,f0,male> the real key observation he made {BREATH} is that(2) a free flying wing can(2) sweep through more sky {BREATH} and generate more power in a unit of time {BREATH} than a fixed wing turbine <sil> <sil> (SaulGriffith_2009-132.26-142.01-F0_M-S3)
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 142.68 153.31 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} so turbines grew and they {NOISE} can now <sil> span up to three hundred feet at the hub height {BREATH} but they can't really go a lot higher <sil> and more height is where the more wind(2) is {SMACK} and more power as much as(2) twice as(2) much {SMACK} <sil> (SaulGriffith_2009-142.68-153.31-F0_M-S3)
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 153.88 158.76 <o,f0,male> {UH} to now we {UM} still have(2) an(2) energy crisis and now we have(2) a climate crisis as(2) well {BREATH} <sil> (SaulGriffith_2009-153.88-158.76-F0_M-S3)
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 159.30 168.45 <o,f0,male> you know(2) <sil> so humans {SMACK} generate about twelve trillion watts or twelve terawatts from fossil fuels {BREATH} and al gore has spoken to(3) {NOISE} why we need to hit one of these targets <sil> (SaulGriffith_2009-159.30-168.45-F0_M-S3)
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 168.84 178.20 <o,f0,male> and in reality {SMACK} what that means is in the next thirty to forty years(2) <sil> we have(2) to make {SMACK} ten <sil> trillion watts or more of new(2) <sil> clean <sil> energy {BREATH} somehow <sil> <sil> (SaulGriffith_2009-168.84-178.20-F0_M-S3)
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 186.77 194.23 <o,f0,male> the(2) majority of it {UH} is in {SMACK} the {UH} higher altitudes above three hundred feet {BREATH} where we don't have(2) a technology as(3) yet <sil> to get there <sil> (SaulGriffith_2009-186.77-194.23-F0_M-S3)
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 194.71 205.21 <o,f0,male> so this is the dawn of the new(2) age of kites {BREATH} this {NOISE} is {UH} our(3) {UH} test site on maui <sil> flying across the sky <sil> i'm(2) now going to show you <sil> the first autonomous generation of power (SaulGriffith_2009-194.71-205.21-F0_M-S3)
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 19.72 28.55 <o,f0,male> if you're at all like me this is what you do with <sil> the(2) sunny summer weekends in san francisco <sil> you build experimental(4) <sil> kite powered hydrofoils {SMACK} capable of more than(2) <sil> thirty(2) knots <sil> (SaulGriffith_2009-19.72-28.55-F0_M-S3)
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 206.15 213.21 <o,f0,male> by {SMACK} every(2) child 's(2) favorite(2) plaything {BREATH} as you can(2) tell you need to(2) be a robot to fly this thing for thousands(2) of hours <sil> it {BREATH} makes you a little {UM} <sil> (SaulGriffith_2009-206.15-213.21-F0_M-S3)
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 214.37 222.74 <o,f0,male> and(2) here we're actually(4) generating about ten kilowatts so enough to <sil> power probably five {SMACK} united states households {BREATH} with a(2) kite not much larger than(2) this piano {BREATH} (SaulGriffith_2009-214.37-222.74-F0_M-S3)
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 223.04 235.38 <o,f0,male> and(2) {NOISE} the real significant(2) thing here is we're developing the control systems <sil> as did the wright brothers <sil> that would enable(2) <sil> sustained long {NOISE} duration flight {UH} and {NOISE} it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either <sil> <sil> (SaulGriffith_2009-223.04-235.38-F0_M-S3)
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 236.48 249.29 <o,f0,male> so this is the equivalent for(2) a kite flier of peeing in the snow {UH} that's tracing your(2) name in the sky {BREATH} and this is where we're actually(4) going(2) so we're {NOISE} beyond the twelve second steps {NOISE} and we're(2) <sil> working towards megawatt scale machines that(2) fly at two thousand feet <sil> (SaulGriffith_2009-236.48-249.29-F0_M-S3)
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 249.70 256.65 <o,f0,male> and(2) generate tons of clean electricity <sil> so you ask how big are(2) those machines {BREATH} well this paper plane would be {SMACK} maybe a(2) <sil> (SaulGriffith_2009-249.70-256.65-F0_M-S3)
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 275.70 286.22 <o,f0,male> so that is audacious you say {BREATH} i agree <sil> but audacious is <sil> what {UH} has happened many times before in history(2) {BREATH} this is a refrigerator(2) factory {SMACK} churning out {UH} airplanes for world {NOISE} <sil> (SaulGriffith_2009-275.70-286.22-F0_M-S3)
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 29.24 37.50 <o,f0,male> and(2) you realize that(2) there is incredible power in the wind(2) {UH} and it can(2) do amazing things and one(2) day <sil> a vessel not unlike this will probably(2) break the world speed record(3) <sil> (SaulGriffith_2009-29.24-37.50-F0_M-S3)
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 298.39 311.70 <o,f0,male> so really this is a story about the(2) audacious plans of young people with these dreams {BREATH} there are(2) many of us {UH} i am lucky enough to work with(2) thirty of <sil> them <sil> and i think we need to support all of the dreams of the kids out there doing these crazy things <sil> thank you <sil> <sil> (SaulGriffith_2009-298.39-311.70-F0_M-S3)
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 37.94 46.90 <o,f0,male> but kites {BREATH} aren't(2) just(2) toys like this <sil> kites {SMACK} i'm {SMACK} going to(2) give you a brief history(2) and tell you about the magnificent future {UH} of {UH} every child 's(3) favorite(2) plaything <sil> (SaulGriffith_2009-37.94-46.90-F0_M-S3)
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 47.46 58.71 <o,f0,male> {UH} so {BREATH} kites are(2) more than(2) a thousand years old and the chinese used them for(2) military applications and even for(2) lifting men so they knew(2) at that stage <sil> they could carry large weights <sil> i'm not sure why(2) there is a hole in this particular(2) {NOISE} (SaulGriffith_2009-47.46-58.71-F0_M-S3)
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 84.00 96.16 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} these two fellows came along {BREATH} and they were(2) flying kites to develop the control systems that would ultimately {NOISE} enable <sil> powered human flight {UH} so this is of course <sil> orville {BREATH} and wilbur wright {SMACK} and the wright flyer <sil> (SaulGriffith_2009-84.00-96.16-F0_M-S3)
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 96.67 105.64 <o,f0,male> and(2) their experiments with(2) kites led to this {UH} momentous occasion where(2) we powered up and(2) took off for the first ever <sil> twelve second(2) {UH} human flight {BREATH} <sil> (SaulGriffith_2009-96.67-105.64-F0_M-S3)
