PatriciaBurchat_2008 1 PatriciaBurchat_2008 804.26 811.66 <o,f0,female> {NOISE} dark energy {SMACK} do we have(2) anything for(2) dark {SMACK} matter <sil> and the(2) answer is yes {BREATH} we have(2) <sil> well motivated candidates for(2) the dark matter <sil> (PatriciaBurchat_2008-804.26-811.66-F0_F-S152)
PatriciaBurchat_2008 1 PatriciaBurchat_2008 80.76 90.49 <o,f0,female> it doesn't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum which(2) is what we use(2) {SMACK} to detect things it doesn't interact at all {BREATH} so how do we know(2) it's there {BREATH} we know(2) it's there by its gravitational effects(2) {BREATH} in fact (PatriciaBurchat_2008-80.76-90.49-F0_F-S152)
PatriciaBurchat_2008 1 PatriciaBurchat_2008 812.07 819.37 <o,f0,female> {UM} now {COUGH} what(2) do {UH} i mean by well {NOISE} motivated {SMACK} i mean that we have(2) <sil> mathematically(2) consistent {SMACK} theories <sil> (PatriciaBurchat_2008-812.07-819.37-F0_F-S152)
PatriciaBurchat_2008 1 PatriciaBurchat_2008 819.89 832.60 <o,f0,female> that(2) were(2) actually(3) introduced {BREATH} to(3) explain {NOISE} a completely different phenomena <sil> ok <sil> things that i haven't even talked about {BREATH} that <sil> each predict {SMACK} the(2) existence(2) {BREATH} of a very <sil> weakly <sil> interacting <sil> new(2) particle <sil> (PatriciaBurchat_2008-819.89-832.60-F0_F-S152)
PatriciaBurchat_2008 1 PatriciaBurchat_2008 832.84 847.09 <o,f0,female> so this is exactly what you want in physics {BREATH} where a <sil> prediction comes out of a mathematically(2) consistent <sil> theory(2) {BREATH} that was actually(4) developed for something <sil> else {BREATH} but we don't(2) know(2) {SMACK} if <sil> either(2) <sil> of those <sil> are actually(4) the dark matter candidate(2) {BREATH} ok one or both <sil> (PatriciaBurchat_2008-832.84-847.09-F0_F-S152)
PatriciaBurchat_2008 1 PatriciaBurchat_2008 847.49 861.15 <o,f0,female> who knows <sil> or it could be something completely different {BREATH} now we look for(2) these dark matter particles {BREATH} because(2) after all they are here <sil> in the room <sil> ok <sil> and they didn't(3) come in the door {BREATH} they just pass through {UM} anything they can come through the building through the(2) <sil> earth {SMACK} they're so <sil> non interacting <sil> (PatriciaBurchat_2008-847.49-861.15-F0_F-S152)
PatriciaBurchat_2008 1 PatriciaBurchat_2008 861.56 870.96 <o,f0,female> so one(2) way to look <sil> for(2) them(2) {BREATH} is to build detectors {SMACK} that are(2) extremely sensitive(2) to(3) a dark matter particle coming through and(2) {NOISE} bumping it {BREATH} so {NOISE} a crystal that will {NOISE} ring <sil> if that happens <sil> (PatriciaBurchat_2008-861.56-870.96-F0_F-S152)
PatriciaBurchat_2008 1 PatriciaBurchat_2008 871.22 878.67 <o,f0,female> so one(2) of my colleagues up the road {BREATH} and his collaborators {BREATH} have(2) built such a detector {BREATH} and they've <sil> put it deep {NOISE} down <sil> in an {NOISE} iron mine {NOISE} in minnesota {COUGH} <sil> (PatriciaBurchat_2008-871.22-878.67-F0_F-S152)
PatriciaBurchat_2008 1 PatriciaBurchat_2008 879.04 890.21 <o,f0,female> ok {NOISE} deep under(2) the ground and in fact in the last couple of days announced {NOISE} the most(2) {SMACK} sensitive(2) results {SMACK} so far {BREATH} they {UM} haven't(2) seen anything <sil> ok {BREATH} but it puts limits <sil> on what {SMACK} the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are {BREATH} (PatriciaBurchat_2008-879.04-890.21-F0_F-S152)

PatriciaBurchat_2008 1 PatriciaBurchat_2008 914.28 928.30 <o,f0,female> now because(2) they are so non interactive {BREATH} they will actually(3) escape {NOISE} the detector {BREATH} so their signature will be {SMACK} missing <sil> energy <sil> ok {BREATH} now unfortunately there is a lot of new(2) physics {SMACK} whose signature could be <sil> missing {NOISE} energy so it will be <sil> hard to tell the difference <sil> (PatriciaBurchat_2008-914.28-928.30-F0_F-S152)
