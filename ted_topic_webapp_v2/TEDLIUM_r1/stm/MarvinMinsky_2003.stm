MarvinMinsky_2003 1 MarvinMinsky_2003 672.16 682.59 <o,f0,male> i hope in the next few years(2) to show that(2) {BREATH} this will(2) lead(2) to(3) smart {UH} machines <sil> and i guess i better skip all the rest of this which(2) are(2) {COUGH} some details on {BREATH} how we might make those smart machines (MarvinMinsky_2003-672.16-682.59-F0_M-S105)
MarvinMinsky_2003 1 MarvinMinsky_2003 689.75 702.51 <o,f0,male> and(2) the main idea is in fact {BREATH} that the core of a(2) {SMACK} really(2) smart machine {SMACK} is {NOISE} one {UH} that {SMACK} recognizes(2) that a certain kind of problem is facing you {SMACK} this is a <sil> problem of such and(2) such a type {COUGH} <sil> (MarvinMinsky_2003-689.75-702.51-F0_M-S108)
MarvinMinsky_2003 1 MarvinMinsky_2003 703.22 717.30 <o,f0,male> and(2) therefore {SMACK} there's a certain {SMACK} way or(2) ways of thinking that are(2) good for(2) that {UH} problem {BREATH} so i think the future main problem of psychology is to classify {BREATH} types of predicaments types of situations {BREATH} types of obstacles {BREATH} <sil> (MarvinMinsky_2003-703.22-717.30-F0_M-S108)
MarvinMinsky_2003 1 MarvinMinsky_2003 718.02 725.59 <o,f0,male> and(2) {BREATH} also to classify {SMACK} available and possible ways to think and pair them up {BREATH} so you see it's almost like a pavlovian {BREATH} (MarvinMinsky_2003-718.02-725.59-F0_M-S108)
MarvinMinsky_2003 1 MarvinMinsky_2003 72.64 80.53 <o,f0,male> <sil> {SMACK} and {UM} the(2) {SMACK} people who avoid {COUGH} that {BREATH} have {UH} thirty(2) percent less infectious disease or(2) something <sil> (MarvinMinsky_2003-72.64-80.53-F0_M-S14)
MarvinMinsky_2003 1 MarvinMinsky_2003 726.58 734.32 <o,f0,male> we lost the first hundred years(2) of psychology {BREATH} by really trivial theories {BREATH} where <sil> you say how do people learn how to react to(3) a situation {SMACK} <sil> (MarvinMinsky_2003-726.58-734.32-F0_M-S108)
MarvinMinsky_2003 1 MarvinMinsky_2003 734.64 742.79 <o,f0,male> what(2) i'm saying is {SMACK} after {UH} we {SMACK} go {NOISE} through a lot of levels <sil> including designing <sil> a huge {COUGH} (MarvinMinsky_2003-734.64-742.79-F0_M-S108)
MarvinMinsky_2003 1 MarvinMinsky_2003 743.85 754.24 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} messy system with {SMACK} thousands(2) of {SMACK} parts {SMACK} we'll end up again {SMACK} with the central problem of psychology saying <sil> not {SMACK} what are {NOISE} the {NOISE} situations but what are(2) the kinds of {SMACK} problems {BREATH} (MarvinMinsky_2003-743.85-754.24-F0_M-S108)
MarvinMinsky_2003 1 MarvinMinsky_2003 754.66 762.60 <o,f0,male> and(2) what(2) are(2) the kinds of strategies {SMACK} how do you learn them(2) how do you connect them up {BREATH} how does(2) a really(2) creative <sil> person invent a new way of thinking {BREATH} (MarvinMinsky_2003-754.66-762.60-F0_M-S108)
MarvinMinsky_2003 1 MarvinMinsky_2003 762.88 770.37 <o,f0,male> out of the(2) available resources and <sil> so forth {BREATH} so i think in the next(2) twenty years {SMACK} if we can get {COUGH} rid of <sil> all of the(2) traditional (MarvinMinsky_2003-762.88-770.37-F0_M-S108)
MarvinMinsky_2003 1 MarvinMinsky_2003 81.15 88.83 <o,f0,male> it {NOISE} was(2) thirty one and a quarter(2) <sil> percent {SMACK} so {UH} if you really want to solve the problem of epidemics and so forth let 's(2) start {COUGH} with(2) that {SMACK} <sil> (MarvinMinsky_2003-81.15-88.83-F0_M-S14)
