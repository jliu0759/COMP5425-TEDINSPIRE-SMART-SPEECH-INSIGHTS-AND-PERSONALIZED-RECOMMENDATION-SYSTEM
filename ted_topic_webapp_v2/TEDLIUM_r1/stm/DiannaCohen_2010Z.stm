DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 106.22 114.88 <o,f0,female> i began(2) talking with people who actually(4) had <sil> been(2) out to the {NOISE} gyre and(2) were(2) studying the plastic problem in the marine environment <sil> and <sil> upon doing so {BREATH} <sil> (DiannaCohen_2010Z-106.22-114.88-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 115.50 124.53 <o,f0,female> {NOISE} i realized(2) actually(3) that cleaning it up {NOISE} would {NOISE} be <sil> a very {NOISE} small drop in the bucket(2) relative to how much is being generated(2) <sil> every day {NOISE} around the world {SMACK} <sil> (DiannaCohen_2010Z-115.50-124.53-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 125.33 132.50 <o,f0,female> {NOISE} and {NOISE} that actually(4) i needed(2) to back up <sil> and look at the bigger picture and the bigger picture is we need to find a way {BREATH} to <sil> turn off the faucet <sil> <sil> (DiannaCohen_2010Z-125.33-132.50-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 132.81 141.24 <o,f0,female> <sil> we need to(3) <sil> cut {UM} the spigot <sil> of <sil> single use <sil> and disposable plastics which are(2) {NOISE} entering <sil> the marine environment {BREATH} every day <sil> on a global scale <sil> (DiannaCohen_2010Z-132.81-141.24-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 141.76 156.07 <o,f0,female> so <sil> in looking at {NOISE} that i also realized(2) that i was really <sil> angry <sil> i wasn't(2) just concerned about {BREATH} plastic that(2) you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the pacific ocean {BREATH} of which(2) i have learned there are(2) now eleven {NOISE} gyres potentially(2) of plastic in five major oceans in the world <sil> (DiannaCohen_2010Z-141.76-156.07-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 169.51 178.16 <o,f0,female> i'm(2) also concerned <sil> about the plastic <sil> in the refrigerator <sil> and i'm concerned about the plastic {SMACK} and(2) the toxins that leach from plastic {NOISE} into <sil> us <sil> and into our bodies <sil> (DiannaCohen_2010Z-169.51-178.16-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 178.76 185.13 <o,f0,female> {UH} so <sil> i came together with a group of {NOISE} other people who were(2) all looking at this issue {SMACK} and we created(2) the plastic pollution coalition <sil> (DiannaCohen_2010Z-178.76-185.13-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 185.60 190.93 <o,f0,female> we have(2) many initiatives that we're working on <sil> but some of them <sil> are very basic <sil> one is <sil> (DiannaCohen_2010Z-185.60-190.93-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 191.50 200.97 <o,f0,female> {NOISE} eighty to(2) ninety percent of what(2) we're finding in the ocean <sil> of the marine debris that we're finding in the(2) ocean is plastic {BREATH} then why(2) don't we call it what(2) it is <sil> it's plastic pollution <sil> (DiannaCohen_2010Z-191.50-200.97-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 210.93 224.16 <o,f0,female> what(2) is the reality of <sil> that <sil> in the(2) united states <sil> less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled {BREATH} and(2) if you really(2) look into(2) it particularly(2) when it comes to plastic bottles {BREATH} most(2) of it is only downcycled <sil> or {NOISE} incinerated or shipped to china <sil> (DiannaCohen_2010Z-210.93-224.16-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 224.42 234.97 <o,f0,female> it is downcycled and turned into lesser things {BREATH} while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again <sil> or <sil> can be used again {BREATH} a plastic <sil> bottle can never be a plastic bottle again <sil> (DiannaCohen_2010Z-224.42-234.97-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 235.49 243.49 <o,f0,female> so this is a big {NOISE} issue for us <sil> another thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about {UH} is {BREATH} we've {NOISE} added <sil> a(2) fourth {UH} r <sil> (DiannaCohen_2010Z-235.49-243.49-F0_F-S11)

DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 267.98 279.55 <o,f0,female> very {NOISE} easy to pick up a stainless steel bottle {NOISE} or a glass bottle if you're traveling and you've forgotten(2) to bring your(2) stainless steel bottle {BREATH} and fill that up with {NOISE} water {BREATH} or filtered water {BREATH} versus(2) purchasing <sil> plastic {SMACK} bottled <sil> water <sil> (DiannaCohen_2010Z-267.98-279.55-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 280.15 290.73 <o,f0,female> i guess what(2) i want to say to everybody here and i know(2) that(2) you guys know(2) a lot about this issue {BREATH} is that <sil> this is a huge problem in the(2) oceans <sil> but this is a problem that we've created as consumers <sil> and(2) we can(2) solve (DiannaCohen_2010Z-280.15-290.73-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 291.16 301.14 <o,f0,female> {NOISE} we can(2) solve this by raising awareness of the issue {BREATH} and <sil> teaching people {BREATH} to(3) choose alternatives {BREATH} so whenever possible to choose alternatives to single use plastics (DiannaCohen_2010Z-291.16-301.14-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 301.45 311.57 <o,f0,female> <sil> we can(2) <sil> cut {UH} the stem tide the stem of this {SMACK} into(2) our oceans {BREATH} and in doing so {BREATH} save our oceans <sil> save our planet <sil> save ourselves <sil> thank you <sil> (DiannaCohen_2010Z-301.45-311.57-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 34.44 43.86 <o,f0,female> upon working with the plastic {NOISE} after about the first eight years(2) some of my work started(2) to(3) {NOISE} fissure <sil> and break down into smaller little bits of plastic <sil> and i thought (DiannaCohen_2010Z-34.44-43.86-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 44.76 47.46 <o,f0,female> <sil> great <sil> it's ephemeral just like {COUGH} us {BREATH} (DiannaCohen_2010Z-44.76-47.46-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 48.92 59.48 <o,f0,female> upon <sil> educating myself a little further about plastics i actually(4) realized(2) <sil> this was <sil> a bad thing {SMACK} it's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits because(2) it's always still plastic {BREATH} (DiannaCohen_2010Z-48.92-59.48-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 59.84 67.92 <o,f0,female> <sil> and what we're finding {NOISE} is that {UH} a lot of it <sil> is in the marine environment <sil> i {NOISE} then <sil> in the last few years(2) learned about <sil> the {UH} pacific garbage patch and(2) the {NOISE} (DiannaCohen_2010Z-59.84-67.92-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 69.41 78.28 <o,f0,female> and(2) <sil> my initial reaction and(2) i think {UH} this is a lot of people 's(2) first reaction to learning about it {SMACK} is <sil> oh my god we've got to go out there and(2) clean this thing up {SMACK} <sil> (DiannaCohen_2010Z-69.41-78.28-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 78.89 89.01 <o,f0,female> so i {NOISE} actually developed a proposal <sil> to(3) {NOISE} go out with(2) a cargo ship {SMACK} and two decommissioned fishing trawlers {BREATH} a crane <sil> a(2) chipping machine and a cold molding machine <sil> (DiannaCohen_2010Z-78.89-89.01-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 89.32 98.57 <o,f0,female> and my intention was to go out <sil> to the {NOISE} gyre raise awareness about this issue {BREATH} and begin to pick up the plastic {BREATH} chip it into little bits <sil> and cold mold it into bricks (DiannaCohen_2010Z-89.32-98.57-F0_F-S11)
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 98.93 105.40 <o,f0,female> could potentially(2) be used {SMACK} as building materials {BREATH} in <sil> underdeveloped communities <sil> (DiannaCohen_2010Z-98.93-105.40-F0_F-S11)
