KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 100.02 105.60 <o,f0,male> this is the field of biologic replacements {BREATH} where we replace(2) worn out parts with new natural ones <sil> (KevinStone_2010U-100.02-105.60-F0_M-S10)
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 105.82 113.36 <o,f0,male> and so {BREATH} the mission is how do i treat these things biologically and let 's(2) talk about {UH} both what(2) i did for(2) my wife and(2) what(2) i've {UH} done for(2) hundreds(2) of other patients {SMACK} (KevinStone_2010U-105.82-113.36-F0_M-S16)
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 113.94 125.75 <o,f0,male> first thing for(2) my wife and the most(2) common thing i hear from my patients(2) particularly(2) in {NOISE} the forty to(2) <sil> eighty year old age group {NOISE} seventy year old age group is they {NOISE} come in and say hey doc {BREATH} isn't there just a shock absorber you can(2) put {SMACK} in my knee i'm not ready for(2) joint replacement <sil> (KevinStone_2010U-113.94-125.75-F0_M-S16)
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 126.13 138.11 <o,f0,male> and so for(2) her i put in a(2) human meniscus allograft {NOISE} donor {BREATH} right {NOISE} into {UH} her {NOISE} knee {SMACK} joint {UH} space and {UH} and then for(2) that(2) {SMACK} unstable ligament {BREATH} we put in a(2) human donor ligament <sil> to stabilize the knee {BREATH} (KevinStone_2010U-126.13-138.11-F0_M-S16)
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 151.88 161.26 <o,f0,male> so here 's(3) my wife 's(2) bad knee on the {SMACK} left and(2) {BREATH} her {NOISE} just(2) hiking now {BREATH} four months later in aspen and doing well {BREATH} and it works not just for(2) my wife <sil> but certainly for(2) other patients(2) <sil> (KevinStone_2010U-151.88-161.26-F0_M-S16)

KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 16.45 26.49 <o,f0,male> so let me just(2) start with my story <sil> so i tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage playing soccer in college {BREATH} then i went on to tear my acl {NOISE} the {UH} ligament in my knee <sil> (KevinStone_2010U-16.45-26.49-F0_M-S16)
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 176.94 190.69 <o,f0,male> so with all this success <sil> why isn't(2) that <sil> good enough you might ask <sil> well the reason is <sil> because(2) {SMACK} there's not enough {UH} donor cycles <sil> there's not enough {COUGH} young healthy people falling off their motorcycle {BREATH} and donating that tissue to us {BREATH} (KevinStone_2010U-176.94-190.69-F0_M-S16)
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 191.71 198.89 <o,f0,male> and <sil> the tissue 's(3) very expensive <sil> and so that's not going to be a solution {NOISE} that's going to get us global with <sil> biologic <sil> <sil> (KevinStone_2010U-191.71-198.89-F0_M-S16)

KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 206.54 219.70 <o,f0,male> <sil> but the <sil> barrier <sil> is {NOISE} immunology {BREATH} and the specific <sil> barrier(2) is a(2) specific(2) <sil> epitope <sil> called the galactosyl {NOISE} or <sil> gal epitope {BREATH} so if we're going to transplant {UH} animal tissues to people we have(2) to figure out a way to get(2) {SMACK} rid of that epitope <sil> (KevinStone_2010U-206.54-219.70-F0_M-S16)
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 239.54 245.90 <o,f0,male> then take that regeneration template(2) {BREATH} and insert it {UH} into(2) <sil> the missing meniscus cartilage to regrow that {UH} <sil> (KevinStone_2010U-239.54-245.90-F0_M-S16)

KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 257.17 264.77 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} that's great when i can(2) degrade the tissue {BREATH} but what(2) happens for(2) your ligament when(3) i need an {SMACK} intact ligament i {SMACK} can't <sil> grind it up in a blender {BREATH} <sil> (KevinStone_2010U-257.17-264.77-F0_M-S16)
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 265.21 272.77 <o,f0,male> so <sil> in that <sil> case i {COUGH} have(2) to design and we designed with <sil> uri {NOISE} galili and(2) {SMACK} tom <sil> turek {BREATH} an <sil> enzyme wash(2) {SMACK} to wash away (KevinStone_2010U-265.21-272.77-F0_M-S16)
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 26.71 35.50 <o,f0,male> and(2) then developed an(2) arthritic knee and i'm sure that(2) many of you in this audience(2) have(2) that same story <sil> and by the way i married a woman who has exactly the same story <sil> (KevinStone_2010U-26.71-35.50-F0_M-S16)

KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 292.47 299.10 <o,f0,male> and(2) we've done that now we've taken <sil> pig ligament <sil> young healthy big tissue {BREATH} put it into {SMACK} ten patients in an {UH} fda {NOISE} approved trial(2) (KevinStone_2010U-292.47-299.10-F0_M-S16)
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 299.45 310.44 <o,f0,male> and(2) then one(2) of our patients went on(2) to have(2) three <sil> canadian masters downhill championships on his pig lig as(2) he calls it so we know(2) it <sil> can work {BREATH} and there's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now {UH} pending <sil> <sil> (KevinStone_2010U-299.45-310.44-F0_M-S16)
